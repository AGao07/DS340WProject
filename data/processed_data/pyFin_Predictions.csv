1glx7j4,"$TOST is probably something that will have boring earnings, but I'm going to play it anyway.",1,"I'm not one for long, drawn-out DD's with oodles of scribbles on graphs, so here's the quick and dirty:  * $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet. * $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open. * $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.  I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow. If it's an earning miss, then we're likely looking at a similar fall of 5%, but I feel it will still add some recovery on Friday/Monday. Price target of $34-$35 after earnings, and if earnings are good, $42-$44 by EOY.

1glrz84,🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀,362,"**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.  **Why the New Japan Deal Matters**  Archer's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.  **Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**  ACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.  **Key Graphs to Watch**  * **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure. * **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same. * **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector. * **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.  **Final Thoughts**  Archer is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.  *(Not financial advice - do your own DD, but this could be one to keep on the radar!)*",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1glrz84/achr_on_the_rise_7_today_and_new_partnership_with/,wallstreetbets,['DD'],Bullish,Bullish

1glgzkk,Recommendations for Lower Risk Investment Strategies - Buffer Savings for Payroll for my Business,7,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling.   Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)  I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done.   Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech.   I've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years.

l6omry,"An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB",144060,"**Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**  &#x200B;  I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.  Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.  To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.  To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.  To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.  To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Note: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post. I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people I'm addressing read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/,wallstreetbets,['GME'],Bearish,Bullish

1gl3rir,Is Trump’s Return a Bullish or Bearish Signal for Real Estate in 2024? Buy the dip on Real Estate ? or NOOOO ??? ,0,"(""If"") Trump makes a comeback in 2024, his policies could have mixed effects on the real estate market.  On one hand, deregulation could boost housing supply by easing construction processes.  On the other hand, his track record of driving up interest rates to manage the budget deficit might make mortgages more expensive and dampen buyer demand.  His push for privatizing entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also hike mortgage rates further, reducing affordability.  So, while we could see more homes being built, it could become harder for average buyers to afford them. Thoughts?

1gl2dp1,Follow-Up Post on Earnings Day: $IONQ Set for a Massive Rally with Multiple Catalysts Ahead,39,"**TL;DR:** Still long $IONQ on earnings day and not planning to sell anytime soon. Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.      **Ticker:** $IONQ   **Industry:** Computer Hardware   **Current Price:** $16.35  A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.  I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.  All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.  https://preview.redd.it/6lj4rzyh0bzd1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=895a8e6b55df96f34886886d734f8659b9472f57  # Sources I recommend:  * Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them. * Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs. * Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption. * IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.  # Revenue Growth and Business Progress  After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.  https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55  This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.  Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.  Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.  https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0  Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.  https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289  With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.  # Business Applications  I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.  This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.  https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe  Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.  https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78  https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1  It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.  The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.  # Options Chain  I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.  https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973  # Institutional and Government Interest  In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.  Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.  # Competitors  For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.  IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.  https://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0  # Bear Thesis  The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.  Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.  But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?  I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.  # Founders  I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.  It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.  # Conclusion  That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gl2dp1/followup_post_on_earnings_day_ionq_set_for_a/,wallstreetbets,['DD'],Bullish,Neutral

Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.  **Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.   **Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.  **Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.  **A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.  **Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different  The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.  The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,stocks,"['DELL', 'SMCI']",Bearish,Neutral

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter.

If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales.

Heed my call.  Position: 311 nov 15 $2.50 calls  Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.  EDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.  Feel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock.

Sorry about the length but TLDR: I have been trying to roll over (changed to withdraw) my JH account since September. It still has not been received due to multiple errors by JH.  September 17ish - I requested a roll over of funds to be wired into a Fidelity account. The wire was returned bc Fidelity needed updated beneficiaries info - okay, whatever. However JH never told me it was returned. I checked on my account, saw the funds weren’t there and had to investigate the reason, JH could still not give me answers but Fidelity did.   September 25 - I updated my info and let JH know to send the wire, they say okay - apparently wire to the wrong location, returned again but this time Fidelity updates me.   September 26 - I update JH of the returned wire and ask to send it correctly but now they tell me this needed to be completed within 10 days of notification or the money would be sent by check & they already sent the check (reminder there was NO notification).  October 7 - Check is received and returned to JH as they didnt put any account info on the check, just FBO name. My name is super common, it would be like saying John Smith.  Nobody alerts me that check is returned.     Oct 14 - Im still waiting for this check to show. Call JH and told everything is fine, fidelity needs to handle. Call Fidelity - no record of check on my account. Oct 16 - JH says all good/Fidelity has no record of check. Oct 17 - Fidelity does system search for amount & finds check, advises they returned it 10days earlier.  Oct 17 - JH knows nothing about check or return, says it must be because USPS but i should stop the check and start the whole process over. So I do, only this time I just have it sent to me so I can work directly with Fidelity. All paperwork is submitted  Oct 21 - JH confirms all paperwork received, everything is fine just waiting for 2-3 days for stop check and 2-3 dates for direct deposit. This week I still call every day M-F for reassurance. Every day everything is fine.  October 29 - still no DD. Call JH and told it paperwork is incomplete bc its missing pgs 7-10 (these pages are all directions). End up getting hung up on by customer service. Call back & told its missing page 2 (a completely blank page about tx funds to a new bank). End up getting hung up on again when questioning validity. At this point i stop calling customer service and call the direct office which was used by ex Employer and talked to specific account manager. He confirms they have lost page 2, but i cant just send it i have to start completely over AGAIN. Fine. Get all paperwork completed and provided and give directly to him.   Oct 30 - verify everything is in order. Verify that i should have $ in 2-3 business days as that is what paper says. He doesnt get back to me until EOB and advises no it will be DD within 10-14 days for JH to do regular review but he did ‘prioritize’ it so should be soon.

1gjd018,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace",0,"**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**  Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.  **Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**  Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market.   Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.  **Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**  Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.  Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position.   **Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**  Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth.   The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.  **Valuation and Investment Prospects**  Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.  **Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**  Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.  Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.  **Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**  In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gjd018/boeing_navigating_challenges_securing_growtha/,investing,['V'],Bullish,Bullish

CEO made 2 announcements in September within 2 days with polar opposite answers, first they were going to move away from (1.6 billion dollar project 25% of market cap) (DRI and EMF for clean environment). Because he didn’t want to front the money for something that would cost more to produce the same product. And then 2 days later the cost will actually be reduced and save them 450 million a year. It’s completely insane to have 2 statements that’s are this contradictory, without of knowing he said something wrong which I’m sure there was instantly a shareholder meeting with executives to revoke this statement right away and to continue to push Biden agenda for clean deal Biden passed for $6 Billion dollar grants for steelmakers. Although Lorenco saying “I don’t think it’s worth it to pony up other $1.1 billion” this is after 500 million $ grant. Both articles linked below with his statements. These articles were within 2 days of one another and cause mass panic at the plant. This was also followed by huge wide layoffs to Cliffs administrators and Subcontractors. The layoffs are still happening. This is not an isolated to my plant but to all Cliffs plants. We’re stacking steel and no one is buying.  I see for the foreseeable future see layoffs continuing until economy starts turning around.Also the head department bosses don’t care about contractor safety and completely neglect safety standards and OSHA Laws to push production and fail to oblige to practical maintenance standards.

1gj33k0,Help me understand something about Intel,17,"Okay so I am obviously missing something - so easy on the pitchforks! I have seen a lot of posts about Intel and they all say its a bad idea because the company might go bankrupt and even if they are bailed out, shareholders will be wiped out.  INTC's current book value as of Sep 2024 is $23.10. This means that if the company CH11's and is liquidated \*right now\* (for the sake of simplicity, i am ignoring liquidity discounts/market discovery/market price fluctuations of assets etc.) shareholders will get 23.10 USD \*after\* settling all debts and liabilities. The stock price is currently $23.20 so its basically trading \*at\* book value. Worst case you lose 10 cents + time value of money on $23.10 while waiting for liquidation/bailout. So where are the ""share price can go to zero"" concerns coming from? Is it simply the concern that they will erode their book value to zero?  Edit: The GM example is not valid. Quick googling (please feel free to double check) shows the GM CH11 filing reported US$82.29 billion in assets and US$172.81 billion in debt.

1ginwra,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,0,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:  Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):  granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:  a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that  b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?  If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.  If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.  Thank you.

1gi22us,SMCI Bullish Outlook,0,"Hey guys, after seeing some recent posts it seems like quite a few of you are taking the bait against SMCI after the news came out with the cooked books. While that is a huge red flag, you cant ignore the massive influence it has in the market and how essential it is in the industry. The net sales almost doubled in 2024 and are expected to double again for 2025. See stats below:  https://preview.redd.it/i2qhjt5yziyd1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=0959cc20eaf4dd1d0339e7b602fdb5cca37dfd4f  As a pilar in the industry, it is heavily focused on the green aspect of its systems as more companies adapt for these AI systems to their data centers.  https://preview.redd.it/yqb04gpkxiyd1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=703999964fb3b4593286a1235000b84b16b0c0b1  I would argue that if the issues came from their core products as in defects, it would have a huge impact on them long-term. I'm positive that there are large investors or firms lining up to take the business with so much upside, all it takes is the right person to make the needle move.

1gi0ewp,The FED won't cut rates on November 7. ,0,"https://preview.redd.it/s5kg8k1sliyd1.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b3f822339878f4e88dfaeb6204086a0af8807  What are these probabilities on the CME FedWatch? I know that they are based on the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, but they don't make any sense. And maybe none of you reading this post, pay too much attention to these probabilities, but I see too many people speculating on a 0.25% rate cut or even a 0.50% rate cut. I consider a 0.50% rate cut beyond any probability. A 0.25% is a probability, but maybe has a probability of 35%. I think the 3rd option has the highest probability, which is an interest rate cut of 0% (so 65%). If you have followed the economic numbers on a weekly basis, you can see that these numbers are way too positive.   *U.S. CB Consumer Confidence (forecast 99.5, actual 108.7):*   Consumers’ assessments of **current business conditions** turned positive in October.  * 21.4% of consumers said business conditions were “good,” up from 18.6% in September. * 16.4% said business conditions were “bad,” down from 20.5%.  Consumers’ appraisals of the **labor market** improved in October.  * 35.1% of consumers said jobs were “plentiful,” up from 31.3% in September. * 16.8% of consumers said jobs were “hard to get,” down from 18.6%.    *U.S. JOLTS Job Openings (forecast 7.980M, actual 7.443 M)*  *U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (forecast 110K, actual 233K)*  *U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (forecast 106K, actual 12K)*  *The Initial Jobless Claims (forecast 229K, actual 216K)*  *Unemployment Rate (forecast 4.1%, actual 4.1%)*  The labor numbers can be quite conflicting, but this is normal given that they are collected using different methodologies. The ADP report covers private sector jobs. The NFP report covers public and private sector jobs and is published by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics state agency. Honestly, I don't know the reason behind the huge differences. Haven't checked it in detail but read that it had to do with the strikes and the hurricane from last month. On the other side, have the Initial Jobless Claims been the lowest since May. And not to forget, have the Average Hourly Earnings also increased on a monthly basis. On a yearly basis it remained the same. In other words, there is nothing wrong with the labor market here and it remains very strong. As seen earlier in my post, this is also reflected in U.S. Consumer Confidence. And ultimately it's human behaviour that drives the markets.    *Core PCE Price Index (YoY) (forecast 2.6%, actual 2.7%)*  With the employment numbers we can see that there is a potential for inflation to rise again. With the Core PCE Price Index we can see that it already did after the first cut.      Conclusion: I think that the FED needs to act very careful here, not to let inflation increase again (or maybe go out of control). It cannot be the intention that there will be another interest rate cut of 0,25% now, and that within six months we will have an additional interest rate hike of 0.25% or even 0.50%. Therefore I think that in November we won't see an interest rate cut, and that in December an interest rate cut of 0,25% might be a possibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gi0ewp/the_fed_wont_cut_rates_on_november_7/,wallstreetbets,['CB'],Neutral,Bearish

1ghyq7o,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,1156,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:  * **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024. * **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period. * **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion. * **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.  However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.  Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:  **Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).  **Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).  **Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).  **Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).  All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.  Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):  A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!  That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.  As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)  And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghyq7o/why_i_think_tsmintc_will_outpace_nvdaamd_growth/,wallstreetbets,['AMD'],Bullish,Bullish
1ghyedq,$GRPN – Maybe things aren’t as they seem at first glance (?),8,"**High short interest – potential for a short squeeze**   Currently, 44.03% of Groupon’s float is shorted (9.26 million out of 39.5 million shares), indicating that the market expects a decline and that investor confidence in GRPN is low. But what if there’s a surprise?  **Q3 YoY traffic growth despite ongoing IT issues**   Despite what appear to be persistent IT issues, Groupon’s traffic in Q3 has grown by approximately 2.9% YoY according to Similarweb (69.4 million in Q3/23 vs. 71.4 million in Q3/24). While this might not seem like a huge success at first glance, in the context of the company’s projected revenue decline of -10% to -5% YoY for Q3—and given that just a few quarters ago, Groupon was essentially headed toward a wall and almost certain death—this growth actually shows a trend reversal. The IT problems likely persist and may continue for some time due to the historically complex system, but the key takeaway is that if traffic is stabilizing or even growing slightly YoY, then management’s most optimistic outlook could be met, or possibly even exceeded.  **New frontend in the U.S. – better conversion rates likely**   Groupon recently launched a new frontend that was initially tested on a small sample of users in the U.S., yielding positive conversion results. Now, it seems that the new frontend has been rolled out across the entire U.S., so it’s reasonable to anticipate improved conversions, which should translate to higher revenue.  I’m not expecting a massive breakthrough, but rather that management is successfully executing their projections to stabilize the company’s cash flow and reverse the long decline in traffic. With the current share price at $10.33 and an expected EBITDA of $60–80 million, the **EBITDA multiple is just 5.1–6.8**. If their outlook is met on the high end or slightly exceeded, and if they project a 5-10% revenue growth for next year, then the current share price is very attractive. Within a reasonable timeframe of 1–2 years, there could be significant revaluation, with the **EBITDA multiple potentially expanding to 10–15x, coupled with organic EBITDA growth**. In addition, there’s a short-term speculative opportunity: a positive outlook could create pressure on short sellers to close positions, potentially driving the stock up in the short term.  **Conclusion and summary:**   With high short interest, traffic growth despite the expected decline, and a new, likely better-converting website in the U.S. (specifically in the Local segment, which is the company’s core business), Groupon’s situation may be far more optimistic than the market expects. Positive results could trigger a short squeeze in the short term, pushing the stock significantly higher.  What do you think? Thanks for your insights!

1ghpfdn,Is anyone else buying up AMD like it's GOLD right now?,549,"The stock is down this week, and I'm convincing myself this is a buy-the-dip moment.  The reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.  This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?  Am I crazy, or is this dip insane?

1ghnclj,SMCI Bull Thesis,2,"I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock. Let’s consider what the positives are at the moment:  1. **The fall from the March high of $1200**. Before the split that would be a drop from \~$1200 to $250 roughly a 80% loss in value. Bull Thesis…well after the split the numbers don’t look as bad. 1200 to 250 seems huge when compared to 120 to 25. So the drop now was only $95 vs $950. Psychologically better for a bull thesis when you look at this way…less room to climb! 2. **SMCI has made a complete u-turn to where it traded this time last year:** $1200 back to $250. Bull Thesis: history may repeat itself and you can do this all over again and not make the mistakes you did last time.  3. **Low cost of entry.** Bull Thesis: If you wait a little bit to buy you may be able to get it at $10. 4. **Hindenburg Report**: Since the report came out two months ago the stock has sold off dramatically. Bull thesis: These claims have not been proven or even discussed by Charles Lang! His silence can only mean these are not true and not worth his time to discuss with shareholders. It is honorable of him to take our time into consideration and not force us to read a statement or watch a video explanation regarding the report.  5. **10k has yet to be filed**. Bull Thesis: No one knows what the status is... so as far as we know it is a fantastic report.  6. **DOJ probe**: Bull Thesis: Everyone knows that the DOJ probes almost every tech stock. There hasn't been much word about this lately, so it probably means the government just forgot about it and it is time to buy calls. 7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price. 8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls.  9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!  So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs. I missed out on all that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghnclj/smci_bull_thesis/,wallstreetbets,['SMCI'],Bullish,Bullish
1ghmkkz,ELV Elevance Health DD,32,"First time poster long time regaurd  This was Anthem Bluecross Blueshield. They are now a conglomerate including pharmacy and specialty services through Carelon.   The Bad:  Recently they lost 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees due to an expiration of expanded eligibility from covid funds. (About 3% of total enrollment) And due to higher utilization of patients this quarter the expense ratio was 2.5% higher than normal. Even though revenue grew $1.5 billion, EPS took a big hit. $8.4 vs $9.7 ~ 20%. Not a good quarter. Share price dropped from 509 to 399 before semi recovering and hovering around 409-430. Down from ATH 560 in August 2024  Debt: $5 billion prior debt, with additional $5 billion just authorized.  Bull Case:  They insure nearly 46 million Americans. Private, Medicare & Advantage, Medicaid combined. 3rd largest Insurer in the US. Operate in 14 states normal operation and 26 states for Medicaid.  Medicare Advantage enrollment just started Oct 15 Ends Dec 7   Medicare enrollment continues to increase annually until peaking in 2030  These 1.5 million Medicaid patients that were dropped will need to seek insurance through one of ELVs more profitable segments Medicare or Advantage. Or through the private market. So I think we will see record enrollment in those segments and re-enrollment in Medicaid in 2025 if they drop coverage for 3 months, continue to be low income and qualify following year 2025 when they report lower incomes in 2024 to shoot for the threshold to get back on.  Buybacks: They authorized $11 billion for buy backs. $8 billion just announced Oct 17th when the price dipped. About 11% of the float. Market cap $96 billion. It's multi year but they are definitely going to buy in at 2 year lows it's trading at now.  https://www.elevancehealth.com/newsroom/elv-quarterly-earnings-q3-2024  Buyback history: high likelihood of $1 Billion + Q4 2024 as they have done in prior years.  https://ycharts.com/companies/ELV/stock_buyback  They just secured an additional $5 billion though notes expiring in 1-40 years for buybacks and acquisitions.

Projected revenue for 2025 is $2.5 billion.  This is a massive additional to the company and huge profit potential. Also the Cofounder was Bill Frist former US Senator so this company has beneficial ties to politics.  https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/bill-saporito/carebridge-its-the-greatest-problem-in-health-care-americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-it.html  Carelon: serves 1/3 Americans. Revenue grew 20% to $13.8 billion. Operating gain was $800 million in Q3. This is where Elevance is expanding most. This is where the most margin can be grown.   P/E ratio: 15, highly profitable monopolistic company with $15 billion cash on hand, which still increased in the 'bad' last quarter by $1.3 billion   Blue chip stock: this is not a crazy valuation play, everyone needs Healthcare and this company highly profitable already. The majority of the Healthcare sector all dipped when Medicaid changed. Even if the election causes turmoil in the markets investors run to blue chips first. It's float is owned by 49% institution investors.  Positions: 26 shares ~ $11,000 @ 431 34 shares ~ $14,000 @ 413  ( I have scwab and robinhood, I'm a pussy and calls are Hella expensive) This is YOLO for me. 95% of my holdings in ELV. All my Palantir profit.  I believe the floor is in at 400 and should turn around quickly. 5 year chart shows dips only last 5-30 days before trend reverses. Prediction of 500+ Q4 2024 earnings. 550+ Q1 2025. The buybacks should increase EPS and the company is strategically acquiring higher margin company's and expanding.   This is not financial advice.

1ghl0zv,Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,70,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.  I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.  I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.  I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.  Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.  Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.  The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.  As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!  I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.  Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.  Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.  For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.  I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?  And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.  I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.  Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.  The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.  Etsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghl0zv/etsys_declining_gross_merchandising_sales_from_a/,stocks,['COO'],Bullish,Bullish

I am unsure of what metric he is using to make that claim. Unless the cow is consuming cash rather than producing it. Regardless, I believe everyone is well aware now that the software side of the business gets almost zero attention from the company. While it is currently widely utilized among 5000+ companies, I believe there will come a time in the coming years that that part of the business just fades away into nothing, likely starting with dwindling product support.  **2.**       **Bitcoin holdings** – The business model of Microstrategy has basically changed to Bitcoin acquisition, and uses a metric MSTR has created called BTC yield, which it touts as the key performance indicator. More about BTC yield is explained in their financials, but essentially it is a measure of the efficiency/cost effectiveness of the way in which they acquire BTC. IT has nothing to do with the returns that BTC can generate the company or a shareholder, as one would think given the term “yield”  **a.**       **Total BTC holdings** – 252, 200, representing approximately 1% of the bitcoin that will ever be in circulation.  **i.**      **Cost** \- \~40, 000 USD per BTC on average, or a total of approximately 10.09B  **ii.**      **Current value -** \~70, 000 per BTC or 17.65B, a total of a 75% value add to the total BTC holdings since acquisition started in 2020  **3.**       **Shares and valuations –** 182.99M shares outstanding (Free float shares 162.91M)  **a.**       **Book value per share –** $18.62, representing a price to book value of \~13.5  **i.**      These numbers do not include any of the BTC on the books, per their financial statements.  **b.**      **BTC value per share -** $96.45 BTC exposure per share.  **c.**       **Current share price –** %250 +/- 20  **d.**      **Book value + BTC value per share –** 115.07 – representing an \*\*\***OVERVALUATION\*\*\*** of the company by $135 per share.  \*\*\***The BTC value per share represents a premium of $153.55 paid per share for the BTC exposure as compared to buying BTC directly\*\* The tradeoff/advantage advertised by Mr. Saylor is that MSTR has the ability to use leverage to acquire more BTC, thus amplifying stock price. The company is, in essence, becoming somewhat of a leveraged ETF for BTC with an extremely high entrance premium. So let’s talk about the effect of that and the stock price vs other strategies an investor could employ.**     **A.**      Volatility drag – Any leveraged product experiences volatility drag (also called volatility decay or beta slippage). Essentially, a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease in the product price (and the underlying price) will result in a lower net price than one started at. Therefore, the losses are amplified by the volatility drag.  **a.**       For example – one dollar increases in value by 10% to 1.10. Then due to the volatility of the dollar, it goes back down 10%. What you are left with is $0.99 rather than $1. This works in reverse as well (1 down to 0.9 then up to 0.99)  **b.**      What this means is that, the higher the volatility, the greater that volatility will decay your initial capital over time  **c.**       In the case of BTC, one of the most volatile holdings someone can include in their portfolio, a 2.5-3x leveraged product will experience 2.5-3x the losses from the swings that BTC will experience.  **i.      THIS IS WHY MSTR price is down 6.5% today while BTC is only down 1.7%**  **ii.**      All leveraged products experience this, which is why leveraged ETF’s are generally not meant to be held long term. The daily rebalancing of the ETF amplifies this decay.  **iii.**      MSTR is obviously not rebalanced daily, but the swings will drive up that decay in a big way  **B.**      The usual price pressures vs those on MSTR  **a.**       MSTR is being labeled as a leveraged ETF. However, leveraged ETF’s and ETF’s in general are subject to the price being heavily influenced by the iNAV rather than buying and selling pressures per se. (intraday net asset value)  **i.**      MSTR, however, is fully subject to the buying and selling pressures as it is a company, not an ETF.  **ii.**      This means that news that triggers a huge selloff can crush the stock price while the BTC it is supposedly tracking (and owning) remains high.  **iii.**      OF course those selling and buying pressures are also heavily influenced by the price of BTC.  So why is everyone enamoured with MSTR, driving the price up? My opinion is that Michael J. Saylor is an incredibly good salesman. He has been selling this so hard since starting bitcoin acquisition and has convinced you to give him money to buy BTC for the company instead of owning any yourself. He has also convinced you his company is better to hold than real BTC ETF’s such as **IBIT or the 2x leveraged BITX.** This simply doesn’t make sense given the numbers above. Bitcoin is the future, no doubt, but you own zero bitcoin by buying into MSTR, but are rather paying for a small amount of exposure. If the company went under tomorrow, despite the shares you own, you would see none of that BTC.  **Beyond that, Michael J. Saylor is an actual crook. He was found to have been filing fraudulent financial statements for MSTR in 2000, pumping the MSTR price. He was fined and disgorged. In June of this year, he reached a settlement with the AG for back-taxes. He had not paid taxes from 2005-2020. This alone is a reason I will never go long in this stock.

The guy only has US experience, and even if he helped Starbucks do a 180 in the US, it won't be enough. Starbucks no longer has an ""aspirational"" factor in China, Chinese people in general are turning against US brands except where the product is clearly exceptional (Apple).

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG)..   Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.  Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.  Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money?   First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession.   We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

1gh6n9s,DD Short EA as their new AAA game Dragon Age Veilguard is a flop (only 55k players online on day 1),9,"Quick and simple. EA Games beat estimates just last week and are almost at all time high. Their top new game for which many people including me were waiting for: Dragon Age Veilguard just came out yesterady, and despite the positive reviews is a woke flop. The positive reviews are due to EA providing review copies only to reviewers which are known to be overly positive (i.e. IGN and the likes) but did not provide copies to others. Now that the game is out it has currently 55k players online on Steam (ranking #29 on Steam). That's embarassing for a first day for an AAA game.   https://preview.redd.it/axvwceayuayd1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=f99bcdf3ea48b27968d60c8bed523393018b1115  TL;DR: Short EA, as their new flagship game Dragon Age Veilguard is a flop.     My position: 200 shares short at 150 USD. I will buy some puts as well. You can hold either till next results or just when the bad reviews come out (probably this week) and analysts realize that the game isn't going to continue selling well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gh6n9s/dd_short_ea_as_their_new_aaa_game_dragon_age/,wallstreetbets,['DD'],Bearish,Bearish

lalucf,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,86487,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**  So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.  I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.  What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.  Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf  In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:  ""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""  It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.  I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.  I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.  More DD: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm  Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner  EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:  * The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts  * I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.  * My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct.   * Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can.   * Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word.   * I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.   If I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.

All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER.  They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it. They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.  It might take just a few days, or weeks... But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price. That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.  We also know they’re down BAD. Why? Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.  So let’s see what tactics they are using:  **Short ladder attacks**:  What is a short ladder attack?  The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting.

Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again.

People don’t seem to realize 3 things:  1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)  2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.  3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media.   SLV inverting GME:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.  **IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion.   **SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.  Silver squeeze not happening links:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly:   **Short Version:** The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.  There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

l78fuh,"I just bought $5,000 in $GME. I would not have done this if the brokerages didn't try to manipulate the market.",75314,"I've been following /r/wallstreetbets for years. Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.  However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see. I don't think of my purchase as an investment, but as putting my own skin in the game as a fuck you against a rigged system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78fuh/i_just_bought_5000_in_gme_i_would_not_have_done/,wallstreetbets,['GME'],Bullish,Neutral
l82y7u,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,75153,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]  Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.  Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~  **Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **  1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today). 2) Scroll all the way down the call list. 3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark). 4) Immediately exercise.  I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.  Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!  P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~  _Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.  _This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._  EDIT:  1) This works for pretty much any stock.  2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.  Example:  - $GME is $300 - The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000 - Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000). - Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)  After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/,wallstreetbets,['GME'],Bullish,Bullish
l7sx9e,"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.",74739,"The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’  In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.  We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?  Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7sx9e/its_time_for_a_government_bailout_of_gme/,wallstreetbets,['GME'],Bearish,Bullish

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are.   By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.  The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in.   If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME.   For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist.   BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO  Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG  Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla.

l7bpf5,30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,68598,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.    Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:   __We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:  1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week. 2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work. 3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear. 4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570. 5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move. 6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling. 7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.  Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.    __I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.  How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.  [Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.  Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o  It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.  __TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__  They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here.

Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver.

That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**  Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.  For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.  This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.  There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.  Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**  GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.  How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:  [Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)  I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**  *TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*  Disclaimer: I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance.

On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.  EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.  EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.  EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.  EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

Here is an FAQ:  1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this. 2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess. 3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell.

le235t,GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,57789,"This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets       [I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)         [How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.         In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.          I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)         [This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)    So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.          Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.         With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

laferl,15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),56968,"Dear SEC and President Biden,  I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.   Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**  Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/   https://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png  (Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)  https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33 https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/  check this out  Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.  Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""     I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW.

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.  As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).  **Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**  In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.  **1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**  You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!  **2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**  If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).  **3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**  So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).  **4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**  Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.  So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎   Edit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \- so you can simply award his original post referenced.

l8lxuy,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:",53075,"There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.  There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.  Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.  Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.  Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.  The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.  \[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]  \[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.  In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.  For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lxuy/if_your_friends_and_family_are_wondering_why/,wallstreetbets,['GME'],Bearish,Neutral

This materialized as DAL and UAL continued their rally, with DAL up another 30% to 60 since my previous DD, primarily driven by US election results and the Trump Trade.    With the upcoming holiday season, tourism and air travel are at the top of mind – DAL and UAL are two domestic airlines best positioned on international, premium, and holiday travel. While UAL offers more INTL, DAL leads in premium and reliability, which are essential for vacation trips.   To get ahead of the holiday season, we aim to gain insight and forecast holiday travel demand and color on air travel going into 2025. With the recent election, recent MAR, ABNB, and EXPE earnings, and shifting macro trends, this post will focus more on forecasting and market dynamics rather than idiosyncrasies within the AI and DAL. We will project air travel demand and other factors affecting air travel and justify a bullish position on DAL going into Investor Day 2024 on 11/20.      Outline   * US Election Impact on Travel Demand, the Airline Industry (AI)  * Macro and industry trend implications for DAL  * MAR, ABNB, EXPE earnings and guidance implications for the AI  * Analysis of DAL's current positioning, performance, and upcoming catalysts  * My Positions   US Election, Trump Trade Impact on Airline Industry (AI)   Largely under the radar, the AI is part of the larger Trump Trade due to the following factors (https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-interest-rate-inflation-today-11-07-2024/card/heard-on-the-street-trump-makes-airlines-great-again-but-why--F7MJW5QDNenQ6RoKscio)   * Green light for M&A (Spirit and JetBlue) to transform the AI landscape  * Deregulation for AI, 2016 precedent  * Falling energy and oil prices with increased US production, 2016 precedent  * Ending wars in Ukraine, the Middle East part of 2024 campaign promise  * Fiscal policy to boost economy and both consumer and corporate spending, driving air travel demand  * Tariffs and other fiscal policy to strengthen the dollar, boosting INTL travel (https://www.marcus.com/us/en/resources/heard-at-gs/what-a-strong-us-dollar-means-for-travel)      Macro and Industry Trends Continue to Favor Airlines  - FED, EXPE earnings, ABNB earnings  * Cutting interest rates globally to boost economic activity continuing into the foreseeable future a tailwind for high-leverage industries such as the AI  * EXPE air revenue up 4% YoY in Q3 compared to 0% in Q2 and 1.7% in Q1, highlighting positive trends  * EXPE air bookings up 7.8% YoY in Q3, compared to 6.6% in Q2 and 1.4% in Q1  * EXPE cited strong air bookings as a main driver for Q3 performance  * EXPE raises FY24 outlook, citing growth and opportunities abroad despite previous travel demand concerns  * EXPE total B2C revenue down 1.4% YoY in Q3 more than offset by 18.4% B2B revenue increase YoY  * Mild B2C Q3 revenue decrease does signal travel softness, but combined with air revenue increase strengthens thesis for increasing shift to longer distance, INTL vacation travel  * ABNB earnings gives insight into travel demand, global  * ABNB Q3 revenue up 10% YoY  * Strong performance in core markets (US, Canada, Australia, UK, France) represents 75% of business  * Sees strong opportunity in expansion into other global markets, bullish sign for INTL travel  * ABNB performance less informative than EXPE on the AI      Current DAL Performance, Positioning, and Upcoming Catalysts   DAL and UAL are industry leaders well-positioned for the upcoming holiday travel season. I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:  * DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total  * Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown)  * Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue  * Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends  * Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends  * Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers  * AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop  * CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20  * Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends  * Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively?  * Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins  * Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections    Throughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3).

1glgzkk,Recommendations for Lower Risk Investment Strategies - Buffer Savings for Payroll for my Business,8,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling.   Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)  I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done.   Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech.   I've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years.

1gke6xh,"For the first time ever, AMD outsells Intel in the datacenter space",239,"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/for-the-first-time-ever-amd-outsells-intel-in-the-datacenter-space  > AMD's datacenter segment revenue reached $3.549 billion in the third quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter and AI group's earnings were $3.3 billion in Q3 2024. Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins. >  > It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales. However, Intel still has to ramp up production of its Granite Rapids products.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gke6xh/for_the_first_time_ever_amd_outsells_intel_in_the/,investing,['AMD'],Bullish,Bullish

1gl079g,Signs of Mergers or Acquisitions?,3,"If Investor Relations stops replying to your emails even though you had been talking to them before and built a relationship with the IR person over the course of many years, and suddenly they haven't responded in weeks, when they used to respond within 15 minutes, is that a sign they are under a quiet period and about to be acquired? Also the company hasn't posted any news updates or company PR in weeks, when they used to post PR frequently. There is also a significant delay in material news that was planned to be released in October, but the company has said nothing. Just radio silence. There have been rumors of the company being bought out, so this is why I'm curious if these are signs of M&A quiet period?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gl079g/signs_of_mergers_or_acquisitions/,stocks,['IR'],Bearish,Neutral
1gkgqx3,Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,82,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**  **Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.  **No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers.   **SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….  >  **Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.  **Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.   **Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.  **Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.  **A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.  **Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different  The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.  The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,stocks,['SMCI'],Bearish,Neutral
