1glx7j4,"$TOST is probably something that will have boring earnings, but I'm going to play it anyway.",1,"I'm not one for long, drawn-out DD's with oodles of scribbles on graphs, so here's the quick and dirty:  * $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet. * $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open. * $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.  I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow. If it's an earning miss, then we're likely looking at a similar fall of 5%, but I feel it will still add some recovery on Friday/Monday. Price target of $34-$35 after earnings, and if earnings are good, $42-$44 by EOY.

1glrz84,🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀,362,"**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.  **Why the New Japan Deal Matters**  Archer's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.  **Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**  ACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.  **Key Graphs to Watch**  * **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure. * **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same. * **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector. * **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.  **Final Thoughts**  Archer is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.  *(Not financial advice - do your own DD, but this could be one to keep on the radar!)*",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1glrz84/achr_on_the_rise_7_today_and_new_partnership_with/,wallstreetbets,['DD']

1glgzkk,Recommendations for Lower Risk Investment Strategies - Buffer Savings for Payroll for my Business,7,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling.   Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)  I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done.   Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech.   I've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years.

l6omry,"An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB",144060,"**Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**  &#x200B;  I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.  Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.  To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.  To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.  To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.  To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Note: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post. I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people I'm addressing read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/,wallstreetbets,['GME']

The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!  The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks.   The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.   This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

1gl3rir,Is Trump’s Return a Bullish or Bearish Signal for Real Estate in 2024? Buy the dip on Real Estate ? or NOOOO ??? ,0,"(""If"") Trump makes a comeback in 2024, his policies could have mixed effects on the real estate market.  On one hand, deregulation could boost housing supply by easing construction processes.  On the other hand, his track record of driving up interest rates to manage the budget deficit might make mortgages more expensive and dampen buyer demand.  His push for privatizing entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also hike mortgage rates further, reducing affordability.  So, while we could see more homes being built, it could become harder for average buyers to afford them. Thoughts?

1gl2dp1,Follow-Up Post on Earnings Day: $IONQ Set for a Massive Rally with Multiple Catalysts Ahead,39,"**TL;DR:** Still long $IONQ on earnings day and not planning to sell anytime soon. Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.      **Ticker:** $IONQ   **Industry:** Computer Hardware   **Current Price:** $16.35  A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.  I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.  All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.  https://preview.redd.it/6lj4rzyh0bzd1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=895a8e6b55df96f34886886d734f8659b9472f57  # Sources I recommend:  * Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them. * Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs. * Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption. * IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.  # Revenue Growth and Business Progress  After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.  https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55  This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.  Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.  Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.  https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0  Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.  https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289  With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.  # Business Applications  I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.  This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.  https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe  Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.  https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78  https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1  It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.  The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.  # Options Chain  I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.  https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973  # Institutional and Government Interest  In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.  Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.  # Competitors  For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.  IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.  https://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0  # Bear Thesis  The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.  Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.  But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?  I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.  # Founders  I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.  It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.  # Conclusion  That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gl2dp1/followup_post_on_earnings_day_ionq_set_for_a/,wallstreetbets,['DD']

Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.  **Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.   **Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.  **Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.  **A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.  **Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different  The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.  The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,stocks,"['DELL', 'SMCI']"

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins. >  > It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales.

1gkcm7b,Lucid Motors Earnings = MASSIVE Tendies,527,"Listen closely regard, you're in the red, your wife is about to divorce you and go with 14in BBC Jamal, even if she gets back with you that smelly fish basket will never be tight again, you can't afford to mess this up. Heed my call.  Position: 311 nov 15 $2.50 calls  Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.  EDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.  Feel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock. Plus   Edit: MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR STOCKS UNSHORTABLE BY PUTTING THEM ON A HIGH SELL OFFER LIKE $50 OR DISABLING BORROWING.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gkcm7b/lucid_motors_earnings_massive_tendies/,wallstreetbets,['ON']

1gjlodu,Why won’t John Hancock give me my money?,0,"Hey all - so the point of this post is the title. Sorry about the length but TLDR: I have been trying to roll over (changed to withdraw) my JH account since September. It still has not been received due to multiple errors by JH.  September 17ish - I requested a roll over of funds to be wired into a Fidelity account. The wire was returned bc Fidelity needed updated beneficiaries info - okay, whatever. However JH never told me it was returned. I checked on my account, saw the funds weren’t there and had to investigate the reason, JH could still not give me answers but Fidelity did.   September 25 - I updated my info and let JH know to send the wire, they say okay - apparently wire to the wrong location, returned again but this time Fidelity updates me.   September 26 - I update JH of the returned wire and ask to send it correctly but now they tell me this needed to be completed within 10 days of notification or the money would be sent by check & they already sent the check (reminder there was NO notification).  October 7 - Check is received and returned to JH as they didnt put any account info on the check, just FBO name. My name is super common, it would be like saying John Smith.  Nobody alerts me that check is returned.     Oct 14 - Im still waiting for this check to show. Call JH and told everything is fine, fidelity needs to handle. Call Fidelity - no record of check on my account. Oct 16 - JH says all good/Fidelity has no record of check. Oct 17 - Fidelity does system search for amount & finds check, advises they returned it 10days earlier.  Oct 17 - JH knows nothing about check or return, says it must be because USPS but i should stop the check and start the whole process over. So I do, only this time I just have it sent to me so I can work directly with Fidelity. All paperwork is submitted  Oct 21 - JH confirms all paperwork received, everything is fine just waiting for 2-3 days for stop check and 2-3 dates for direct deposit. This week I still call every day M-F for reassurance. Every day everything is fine.  October 29 - still no DD. Call JH and told it paperwork is incomplete bc its missing pgs 7-10 (these pages are all directions). End up getting hung up on by customer service. Call back & told its missing page 2 (a completely blank page about tx funds to a new bank). End up getting hung up on again when questioning validity. At this point i stop calling customer service and call the direct office which was used by ex Employer and talked to specific account manager. He confirms they have lost page 2, but i cant just send it i have to start completely over AGAIN. Fine. Get all paperwork completed and provided and give directly to him.   Oct 30 - verify everything is in order. Verify that i should have $ in 2-3 business days as that is what paper says. He doesnt get back to me until EOB and advises no it will be DD within 10-14 days for JH to do regular review but he did ‘prioritize’ it so should be soon.

1gjd018,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace",0,"**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**  Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.  **Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**  Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market.   Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.  **Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**  Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.  Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position.   **Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**  Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth.   The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.  **Valuation and Investment Prospects**  Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.  **Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**  Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.  Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.  **Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**  In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gjd018/boeing_navigating_challenges_securing_growtha/,investing,['V']
1gj53dk,Cliffs Puts,29,"I work for cliffs on-site Middletown location. Everything seems extremely ambiguous and more so a cover up for lack of demand. CEO made 2 announcements in September within 2 days with polar opposite answers, first they were going to move away from (1.6 billion dollar project 25% of market cap) (DRI and EMF for clean environment). Because he didn’t want to front the money for something that would cost more to produce the same product. And then 2 days later the cost will actually be reduced and save them 450 million a year. It’s completely insane to have 2 statements that’s are this contradictory, without of knowing he said something wrong which I’m sure there was instantly a shareholder meeting with executives to revoke this statement right away and to continue to push Biden agenda for clean deal Biden passed for $6 Billion dollar grants for steelmakers. Although Lorenco saying “I don’t think it’s worth it to pony up other $1.1 billion” this is after 500 million $ grant. Both articles linked below with his statements. These articles were within 2 days of one another and cause mass panic at the plant. This was also followed by huge wide layoffs to Cliffs administrators and Subcontractors. The layoffs are still happening. This is not an isolated to my plant but to all Cliffs plants. We’re stacking steel and no one is buying.  I see for the foreseeable future see layoffs continuing until economy starts turning around.Also the head department bosses don’t care about contractor safety and completely neglect safety standards and OSHA Laws to push production and fail to oblige to practical maintenance standards.

1gj33k0,Help me understand something about Intel,17,"Okay so I am obviously missing something - so easy on the pitchforks! I have seen a lot of posts about Intel and they all say its a bad idea because the company might go bankrupt and even if they are bailed out, shareholders will be wiped out.  INTC's current book value as of Sep 2024 is $23.10. This means that if the company CH11's and is liquidated \*right now\* (for the sake of simplicity, i am ignoring liquidity discounts/market discovery/market price fluctuations of assets etc.) shareholders will get 23.10 USD \*after\* settling all debts and liabilities. The stock price is currently $23.20 so its basically trading \*at\* book value. Worst case you lose 10 cents + time value of money on $23.10 while waiting for liquidation/bailout. So where are the ""share price can go to zero"" concerns coming from? Is it simply the concern that they will erode their book value to zero?  Edit: The GM example is not valid. Quick googling (please feel free to double check) shows the GM CH11 filing reported US$82.29 billion in assets and US$172.81 billion in debt.

1ginwra,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,0,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:  Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):  granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:  a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that  b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?  If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.  If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.  Thank you.

1gi22us,SMCI Bullish Outlook,0,"Hey guys, after seeing some recent posts it seems like quite a few of you are taking the bait against SMCI after the news came out with the cooked books. While that is a huge red flag, you cant ignore the massive influence it has in the market and how essential it is in the industry. The net sales almost doubled in 2024 and are expected to double again for 2025. See stats below:  https://preview.redd.it/i2qhjt5yziyd1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=0959cc20eaf4dd1d0339e7b602fdb5cca37dfd4f  As a pilar in the industry, it is heavily focused on the green aspect of its systems as more companies adapt for these AI systems to their data centers.  https://preview.redd.it/yqb04gpkxiyd1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=703999964fb3b4593286a1235000b84b16b0c0b1  I would argue that if the issues came from their core products as in defects, it would have a huge impact on them long-term. I'm positive that there are large investors or firms lining up to take the business with so much upside, all it takes is the right person to make the needle move.

1gi0ewp,The FED won't cut rates on November 7. ,0,"https://preview.redd.it/s5kg8k1sliyd1.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b3f822339878f4e88dfaeb6204086a0af8807  What are these probabilities on the CME FedWatch? I know that they are based on the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, but they don't make any sense. And maybe none of you reading this post, pay too much attention to these probabilities, but I see too many people speculating on a 0.25% rate cut or even a 0.50% rate cut. I consider a 0.50% rate cut beyond any probability. A 0.25% is a probability, but maybe has a probability of 35%. I think the 3rd option has the highest probability, which is an interest rate cut of 0% (so 65%). If you have followed the economic numbers on a weekly basis, you can see that these numbers are way too positive.   *U.S. CB Consumer Confidence (forecast 99.5, actual 108.7):*   Consumers’ assessments of **current business conditions** turned positive in October.  * 21.4% of consumers said business conditions were “good,” up from 18.6% in September. * 16.4% said business conditions were “bad,” down from 20.5%.  Consumers’ appraisals of the **labor market** improved in October.  * 35.1% of consumers said jobs were “plentiful,” up from 31.3% in September. * 16.8% of consumers said jobs were “hard to get,” down from 18.6%.    *U.S. JOLTS Job Openings (forecast 7.980M, actual 7.443 M)*  *U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (forecast 110K, actual 233K)*  *U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (forecast 106K, actual 12K)*  *The Initial Jobless Claims (forecast 229K, actual 216K)*  *Unemployment Rate (forecast 4.1%, actual 4.1%)*  The labor numbers can be quite conflicting, but this is normal given that they are collected using different methodologies. The ADP report covers private sector jobs. The NFP report covers public and private sector jobs and is published by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics state agency. Honestly, I don't know the reason behind the huge differences. Haven't checked it in detail but read that it had to do with the strikes and the hurricane from last month. On the other side, have the Initial Jobless Claims been the lowest since May. And not to forget, have the Average Hourly Earnings also increased on a monthly basis. On a yearly basis it remained the same. In other words, there is nothing wrong with the labor market here and it remains very strong. As seen earlier in my post, this is also reflected in U.S. Consumer Confidence. And ultimately it's human behaviour that drives the markets.    *Core PCE Price Index (YoY) (forecast 2.6%, actual 2.7%)*  With the employment numbers we can see that there is a potential for inflation to rise again. With the Core PCE Price Index we can see that it already did after the first cut.      Conclusion: I think that the FED needs to act very careful here, not to let inflation increase again (or maybe go out of control). It cannot be the intention that there will be another interest rate cut of 0,25% now, and that within six months we will have an additional interest rate hike of 0.25% or even 0.50%. Therefore I think that in November we won't see an interest rate cut, and that in December an interest rate cut of 0,25% might be a possibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gi0ewp/the_fed_wont_cut_rates_on_november_7/,wallstreetbets,['CB']

1ghyq7o,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,1156,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:  * **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024. * **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period. * **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion. * **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.  However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.  Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:  **Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).  **Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).  **Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).  **Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).  All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.  Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):  A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!  That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.  As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)  And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghyq7o/why_i_think_tsmintc_will_outpace_nvdaamd_growth/,wallstreetbets,['AMD']
1ghyedq,$GRPN – Maybe things aren’t as they seem at first glance (?),8,"**High short interest – potential for a short squeeze**   Currently, 44.03% of Groupon’s float is shorted (9.26 million out of 39.5 million shares), indicating that the market expects a decline and that investor confidence in GRPN is low. But what if there’s a surprise?  **Q3 YoY traffic growth despite ongoing IT issues**   Despite what appear to be persistent IT issues, Groupon’s traffic in Q3 has grown by approximately 2.9% YoY according to Similarweb (69.4 million in Q3/23 vs. 71.4 million in Q3/24). While this might not seem like a huge success at first glance, in the context of the company’s projected revenue decline of -10% to -5% YoY for Q3—and given that just a few quarters ago, Groupon was essentially headed toward a wall and almost certain death—this growth actually shows a trend reversal. The IT problems likely persist and may continue for some time due to the historically complex system, but the key takeaway is that if traffic is stabilizing or even growing slightly YoY, then management’s most optimistic outlook could be met, or possibly even exceeded.  **New frontend in the U.S. – better conversion rates likely**   Groupon recently launched a new frontend that was initially tested on a small sample of users in the U.S., yielding positive conversion results. Now, it seems that the new frontend has been rolled out across the entire U.S., so it’s reasonable to anticipate improved conversions, which should translate to higher revenue.  I’m not expecting a massive breakthrough, but rather that management is successfully executing their projections to stabilize the company’s cash flow and reverse the long decline in traffic. With the current share price at $10.33 and an expected EBITDA of $60–80 million, the **EBITDA multiple is just 5.1–6.8**. If their outlook is met on the high end or slightly exceeded, and if they project a 5-10% revenue growth for next year, then the current share price is very attractive. Within a reasonable timeframe of 1–2 years, there could be significant revaluation, with the **EBITDA multiple potentially expanding to 10–15x, coupled with organic EBITDA growth**. In addition, there’s a short-term speculative opportunity: a positive outlook could create pressure on short sellers to close positions, potentially driving the stock up in the short term.  **Conclusion and summary:**   With high short interest, traffic growth despite the expected decline, and a new, likely better-converting website in the U.S. (specifically in the Local segment, which is the company’s core business), Groupon’s situation may be far more optimistic than the market expects. Positive results could trigger a short squeeze in the short term, pushing the stock significantly higher.  What do you think? Thanks for your insights!

1ghpfdn,Is anyone else buying up AMD like it's GOLD right now?,549,"The stock is down this week, and I'm convincing myself this is a buy-the-dip moment.  The reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.  This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?  Am I crazy, or is this dip insane?

1ghnclj,SMCI Bull Thesis,2,"I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock. Let’s consider what the positives are at the moment:  1. **The fall from the March high of $1200**. Before the split that would be a drop from \~$1200 to $250 roughly a 80% loss in value. Bull Thesis…well after the split the numbers don’t look as bad. 1200 to 250 seems huge when compared to 120 to 25. So the drop now was only $95 vs $950. Psychologically better for a bull thesis when you look at this way…less room to climb! 2. **SMCI has made a complete u-turn to where it traded this time last year:** $1200 back to $250. Bull Thesis: history may repeat itself and you can do this all over again and not make the mistakes you did last time.  3. **Low cost of entry.** Bull Thesis: If you wait a little bit to buy you may be able to get it at $10. 4. **Hindenburg Report**: Since the report came out two months ago the stock has sold off dramatically. Bull thesis: These claims have not been proven or even discussed by Charles Lang! His silence can only mean these are not true and not worth his time to discuss with shareholders. It is honorable of him to take our time into consideration and not force us to read a statement or watch a video explanation regarding the report.  5. **10k has yet to be filed**. Bull Thesis: No one knows what the status is... so as far as we know it is a fantastic report.  6. **DOJ probe**: Bull Thesis: Everyone knows that the DOJ probes almost every tech stock. There hasn't been much word about this lately, so it probably means the government just forgot about it and it is time to buy calls. 7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price. 8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls.  9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!  So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs. I missed out on all that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ghnclj/smci_bull_thesis/,wallstreetbets,['SMCI']
1ghmkkz,ELV Elevance Health DD,32,"First time poster long time regaurd  This was Anthem Bluecross Blueshield. They are now a conglomerate including pharmacy and specialty services through Carelon.   The Bad:  Recently they lost 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees due to an expiration of expanded eligibility from covid funds. (About 3% of total enrollment) And due to higher utilization of patients this quarter the expense ratio was 2.5% higher than normal. Even though revenue grew $1.5 billion, EPS took a big hit. $8.4 vs $9.7 ~ 20%. Not a good quarter. Share price dropped from 509 to 399 before semi recovering and hovering around 409-430. Down from ATH 560 in August 2024  Debt: $5 billion prior debt, with additional $5 billion just authorized.  Bull Case:  They insure nearly 46 million Americans. Private, Medicare & Advantage, Medicaid combined. 3rd largest Insurer in the US. Operate in 14 states normal operation and 26 states for Medicaid.  Medicare Advantage enrollment just started Oct 15 Ends Dec 7   Medicare enrollment continues to increase annually until peaking in 2030  These 1.5 million Medicaid patients that were dropped will need to seek insurance through one of ELVs more profitable segments Medicare or Advantage. Or through the private market. So I think we will see record enrollment in those segments and re-enrollment in Medicaid in 2025 if they drop coverage for 3 months, continue to be low income and qualify following year 2025 when they report lower incomes in 2024 to shoot for the threshold to get back on.  Buybacks: They authorized $11 billion for buy backs. $8 billion just announced Oct 17th when the price dipped. About 11% of the float. Market cap $96 billion. It's multi year but they are definitely going to buy in at 2 year lows it's trading at now.  https://www.elevancehealth.com/newsroom/elv-quarterly-earnings-q3-2024  Buyback history: high likelihood of $1 Billion + Q4 2024 as they have done in prior years.  https://ycharts.com/companies/ELV/stock_buyback  They just secured an additional $5 billion though notes expiring in 1-40 years for buybacks and acquisitions.

Projected revenue for 2025 is $2.5 billion.  This is a massive additional to the company and huge profit potential. Also the Cofounder was Bill Frist former US Senator so this company has beneficial ties to politics.  https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/bill-saporito/carebridge-its-the-greatest-problem-in-health-care-americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-it.html  Carelon: serves 1/3 Americans. Revenue grew 20% to $13.8 billion. Operating gain was $800 million in Q3. This is where Elevance is expanding most. This is where the most margin can be grown.   P/E ratio: 15, highly profitable monopolistic company with $15 billion cash on hand, which still increased in the 'bad' last quarter by $1.3 billion   Blue chip stock: this is not a crazy valuation play, everyone needs Healthcare and this company highly profitable already. The majority of the Healthcare sector all dipped when Medicaid changed. Even if the election causes turmoil in the markets investors run to blue chips first. It's float is owned by 49% institution investors.  Positions: 26 shares ~ $11,000 @ 431 34 shares ~ $14,000 @ 413  ( I have scwab and robinhood, I'm a pussy and calls are Hella expensive) This is YOLO for me. 95% of my holdings in ELV. All my Palantir profit.  I believe the floor is in at 400 and should turn around quickly. 5 year chart shows dips only last 5-30 days before trend reverses. Prediction of 500+ Q4 2024 earnings. 550+ Q1 2025. The buybacks should increase EPS and the company is strategically acquiring higher margin company's and expanding.   This is not financial advice.

1ghl0zv,Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,70,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.  I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.  I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.  I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.  Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.  Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.  The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.  As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!  I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.  Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.  Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.  For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.  I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?  And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.  I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.  Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.  The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.  Etsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghl0zv/etsys_declining_gross_merchandising_sales_from_a/,stocks,['COO']

I only put the two most important lines up in that description  **Market Capitalization** **-** $45.21B  **The numbers/financials:**  **1.**       **The (somewhat obsolete) core software business**  \- A disclaimer – these numbers currently aren’t factoring into the price of MSTR.

The problem here is contraction in profits and revenues consistently.\*\***  Saylor has recently described the software side of the business as a “cash cow” on an interview. I am unsure of what metric he is using to make that claim. Unless the cow is consuming cash rather than producing it. Regardless, I believe everyone is well aware now that the software side of the business gets almost zero attention from the company. While it is currently widely utilized among 5000+ companies, I believe there will come a time in the coming years that that part of the business just fades away into nothing, likely starting with dwindling product support.  **2.**       **Bitcoin holdings** – The business model of Microstrategy has basically changed to Bitcoin acquisition, and uses a metric MSTR has created called BTC yield, which it touts as the key performance indicator. More about BTC yield is explained in their financials, but essentially it is a measure of the efficiency/cost effectiveness of the way in which they acquire BTC. IT has nothing to do with the returns that BTC can generate the company or a shareholder, as one would think given the term “yield”  **a.**       **Total BTC holdings** – 252, 200, representing approximately 1% of the bitcoin that will ever be in circulation.  **i.**      **Cost** \- \~40, 000 USD per BTC on average, or a total of approximately 10.09B  **ii.**      **Current value -** \~70, 000 per BTC or 17.65B, a total of a 75% value add to the total BTC holdings since acquisition started in 2020  **3.**       **Shares and valuations –** 182.99M shares outstanding (Free float shares 162.91M)  **a.**       **Book value per share –** $18.62, representing a price to book value of \~13.5  **i.**      These numbers do not include any of the BTC on the books, per their financial statements.  **b.**      **BTC value per share -** $96.45 BTC exposure per share.  **c.**       **Current share price –** %250 +/- 20  **d.**      **Book value + BTC value per share –** 115.07 – representing an \*\*\***OVERVALUATION\*\*\*** of the company by $135 per share.  \*\*\***The BTC value per share represents a premium of $153.55 paid per share for the BTC exposure as compared to buying BTC directly\*\* The tradeoff/advantage advertised by Mr. Saylor is that MSTR has the ability to use leverage to acquire more BTC, thus amplifying stock price. The company is, in essence, becoming somewhat of a leveraged ETF for BTC with an extremely high entrance premium. So let’s talk about the effect of that and the stock price vs other strategies an investor could employ.**     **A.**      Volatility drag – Any leveraged product experiences volatility drag (also called volatility decay or beta slippage). Essentially, a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease in the product price (and the underlying price) will result in a lower net price than one started at. Therefore, the losses are amplified by the volatility drag.  **a.**       For example – one dollar increases in value by 10% to 1.10. Then due to the volatility of the dollar, it goes back down 10%. What you are left with is $0.99 rather than $1. This works in reverse as well (1 down to 0.9 then up to 0.99)  **b.**      What this means is that, the higher the volatility, the greater that volatility will decay your initial capital over time  **c.**       In the case of BTC, one of the most volatile holdings someone can include in their portfolio, a 2.5-3x leveraged product will experience 2.5-3x the losses from the swings that BTC will experience.  **i.      THIS IS WHY MSTR price is down 6.5% today while BTC is only down 1.7%**  **ii.**      All leveraged products experience this, which is why leveraged ETF’s are generally not meant to be held long term. The daily rebalancing of the ETF amplifies this decay.  **iii.**      MSTR is obviously not rebalanced daily, but the swings will drive up that decay in a big way  **B.**      The usual price pressures vs those on MSTR  **a.**       MSTR is being labeled as a leveraged ETF. However, leveraged ETF’s and ETF’s in general are subject to the price being heavily influenced by the iNAV rather than buying and selling pressures per se. (intraday net asset value)  **i.**      MSTR, however, is fully subject to the buying and selling pressures as it is a company, not an ETF.  **ii.**      This means that news that triggers a huge selloff can crush the stock price while the BTC it is supposedly tracking (and owning) remains high.  **iii.**      OF course those selling and buying pressures are also heavily influenced by the price of BTC.  So why is everyone enamoured with MSTR, driving the price up? My opinion is that Michael J. Saylor is an incredibly good salesman. He has been selling this so hard since starting bitcoin acquisition and has convinced you to give him money to buy BTC for the company instead of owning any yourself. He has also convinced you his company is better to hold than real BTC ETF’s such as **IBIT or the 2x leveraged BITX.** This simply doesn’t make sense given the numbers above. Bitcoin is the future, no doubt, but you own zero bitcoin by buying into MSTR, but are rather paying for a small amount of exposure. If the company went under tomorrow, despite the shares you own, you would see none of that BTC.  **Beyond that, Michael J. Saylor is an actual crook. He was found to have been filing fraudulent financial statements for MSTR in 2000, pumping the MSTR price. He was fined and disgorged. In June of this year, he reached a settlement with the AG for back-taxes. He had not paid taxes from 2005-2020. This alone is a reason I will never go long in this stock. He is selling you half empty glasses of future promises.**  [**https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-16829**](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-16829)  [**https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-secures-40-million**](https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-secures-40-million)  **As for me, I will be shorting this stock daily only, but likely through options rather than short sales due to the risk that short term volatility brings.

The guy only has US experience, and even if he helped Starbucks do a 180 in the US, it won't be enough. Starbucks no longer has an ""aspirational"" factor in China, Chinese people in general are turning against US brands except where the product is clearly exceptional (Apple).

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG)..   Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.  Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.  Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money?   First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession.   We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn.

1gh6n9s,DD Short EA as their new AAA game Dragon Age Veilguard is a flop (only 55k players online on day 1),9,"Quick and simple. EA Games beat estimates just last week and are almost at all time high. Their top new game for which many people including me were waiting for: Dragon Age Veilguard just came out yesterady, and despite the positive reviews is a woke flop. The positive reviews are due to EA providing review copies only to reviewers which are known to be overly positive (i.e. IGN and the likes) but did not provide copies to others. Now that the game is out it has currently 55k players online on Steam (ranking #29 on Steam). That's embarassing for a first day for an AAA game.   https://preview.redd.it/axvwceayuayd1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=f99bcdf3ea48b27968d60c8bed523393018b1115  TL;DR: Short EA, as their new flagship game Dragon Age Veilguard is a flop.     My position: 200 shares short at 150 USD. I will buy some puts as well. You can hold either till next results or just when the bad reviews come out (probably this week) and analysts realize that the game isn't going to continue selling well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gh6n9s/dd_short_ea_as_their_new_aaa_game_dragon_age/,wallstreetbets,['DD']
