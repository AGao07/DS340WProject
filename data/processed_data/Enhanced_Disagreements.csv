1glx7j4,"I'm not one for long, drawn-out DD's with oodles of scribbles on graphs, so here's the quick and dirty:  * $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet. * $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open. * $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.  I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow.

I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling.   Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)  I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done.   Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech.

l6omry,"**Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**  &#x200B;  I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.  Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.  To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.  To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.  To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.  To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Note: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post.

1gl2dp1,"**TL;DR:** Still long $IONQ on earnings day and not planning to sell anytime soon. Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.      **Ticker:** $IONQ   **Industry:** Computer Hardware   **Current Price:** $16.35  A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.  I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.  All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.  https://preview.redd.it/6lj4rzyh0bzd1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=895a8e6b55df96f34886886d734f8659b9472f57  # Sources I recommend:  * Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them. * Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs. * Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption. * IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.  # Revenue Growth and Business Progress  After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.  https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55  This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.  Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.  Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.  https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0  Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.  https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289  With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.  # Business Applications  I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.  This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.  https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe  Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.  https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78  https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1  It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.  The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.  # Options Chain  I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.  https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973  # Institutional and Government Interest  In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.  Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.  # Competitors  For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.  IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.  https://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0  # Bear Thesis  The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.  Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.  But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?  I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.  # Founders  I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.  It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.  # Conclusion  That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",Follow-Up Post on Earnings Day: $IONQ Set for a Massive Rally with Multiple Catalysts Ahead,"{'additive_match': True, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}",True,False,False,False,91,9867,0,362,3,586,15,1301,5.133333333333334,6.543428132205995

1gkgqx3,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**  **Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.  **No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers.   **SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….  >  **Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.  **Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.   **Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.  **Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.  **A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.  **Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different  The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.  The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.",Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': True, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}",True,False,False,False,70,2873,2,29,3,129,12,469,4.916666666666667,5.095948827292111

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter.

It still has not been received due to multiple errors by JH.  September 17ish - I requested a roll over of funds to be wired into a Fidelity account. The wire was returned bc Fidelity needed updated beneficiaries info - okay, whatever. However JH never told me it was returned. I checked on my account, saw the funds weren’t there and had to investigate the reason, JH could still not give me answers but Fidelity did.   September 25 - I updated my info and let JH know to send the wire, they say okay - apparently wire to the wrong location, returned again but this time Fidelity updates me.   September 26 - I update JH of the returned wire and ask to send it correctly but now they tell me this needed to be completed within 10 days of notification or the money would be sent by check & they already sent the check (reminder there was NO notification).  October 7 - Check is received and returned to JH as they didnt put any account info on the check, just FBO name. My name is super common, it would be like saying John Smith.  Nobody alerts me that check is returned.     Oct 14 - Im still waiting for this check to show. Call JH and told everything is fine, fidelity needs to handle. Call Fidelity - no record of check on my account. Oct 16 - JH says all good/Fidelity has no record of check. Oct 17 - Fidelity does system search for amount & finds check, advises they returned it 10days earlier.  Oct 17 - JH knows nothing about check or return, says it must be because USPS but i should stop the check and start the whole process over. So I do, only this time I just have it sent to me so I can work directly with Fidelity. All paperwork is submitted  Oct 21 - JH confirms all paperwork received, everything is fine just waiting for 2-3 days for stop check and 2-3 dates for direct deposit. This week I still call every day M-F for reassurance. Every day everything is fine.  October 29 - still no DD. Call JH and told it paperwork is incomplete bc its missing pgs 7-10 (these pages are all directions). End up getting hung up on by customer service. Call back & told its missing page 2 (a completely blank page about tx funds to a new bank). End up getting hung up on again when questioning validity. At this point i stop calling customer service and call the direct office which was used by ex Employer and talked to specific account manager. He confirms they have lost page 2, but i cant just send it i have to start completely over AGAIN. Fine. Get all paperwork completed and provided and give directly to him.   Oct 30 - verify everything is in order. Verify that i should have $ in 2-3 business days as that is what paper says. He doesnt get back to me until EOB and advises no it will be DD within 10-14 days for JH to do regular review but he did ‘prioritize’ it so should be soon.

I know that they are based on the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, but they don't make any sense. And maybe none of you reading this post, pay too much attention to these probabilities, but I see too many people speculating on a 0.25% rate cut or even a 0.50% rate cut. I consider a 0.50% rate cut beyond any probability. A 0.25% is a probability, but maybe has a probability of 35%. I think the 3rd option has the highest probability, which is an interest rate cut of 0% (so 65%). If you have followed the economic numbers on a weekly basis, you can see that these numbers are way too positive.   *U.S. CB Consumer Confidence (forecast 99.5, actual 108.7):*   Consumers’ assessments of **current business conditions** turned positive in October.  * 21.4% of consumers said business conditions were “good,” up from 18.6% in September. * 16.4% said business conditions were “bad,” down from 20.5%.  Consumers’ appraisals of the **labor market** improved in October.  * 35.1% of consumers said jobs were “plentiful,” up from 31.3% in September. * 16.8% of consumers said jobs were “hard to get,” down from 18.6%.    *U.S. JOLTS Job Openings (forecast 7.980M, actual 7.443 M)*  *U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (forecast 110K, actual 233K)*  *U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (forecast 106K, actual 12K)*  *The Initial Jobless Claims (forecast 229K, actual 216K)*  *Unemployment Rate (forecast 4.1%, actual 4.1%)*  The labor numbers can be quite conflicting, but this is normal given that they are collected using different methodologies. The ADP report covers private sector jobs. The NFP report covers public and private sector jobs and is published by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics state agency. Honestly, I don't know the reason behind the huge differences. Haven't checked it in detail but read that it had to do with the strikes and the hurricane from last month. On the other side, have the Initial Jobless Claims been the lowest since May. And not to forget, have the Average Hourly Earnings also increased on a monthly basis. On a yearly basis it remained the same. In other words, there is nothing wrong with the labor market here and it remains very strong. As seen earlier in my post, this is also reflected in U.S. Consumer Confidence. And ultimately it's human behaviour that drives the markets.    *Core PCE Price Index (YoY) (forecast 2.6%, actual 2.7%)*  With the employment numbers we can see that there is a potential for inflation to rise again. With the Core PCE Price Index we can see that it already did after the first cut.      Conclusion: I think that the FED needs to act very careful here, not to let inflation increase again (or maybe go out of control). It cannot be the intention that there will be another interest rate cut of 0,25% now, and that within six months we will have an additional interest rate hike of 0.25% or even 0.50%. Therefore I think that in November we won't see an interest rate cut, and that in December an interest rate cut of 0,25% might be a possibility.",The FED won't cut rates on November 7. ,"{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': True, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}",True,False,False,False,39,3173,1,130,2,191,8,521,3.875,5.044145873320537

1ghyedq,"**High short interest – potential for a short squeeze**   Currently, 44.03% of Groupon’s float is shorted (9.26 million out of 39.5 million shares), indicating that the market expects a decline and that investor confidence in GRPN is low. But what if there’s a surprise?  **Q3 YoY traffic growth despite ongoing IT issues**   Despite what appear to be persistent IT issues, Groupon’s traffic in Q3 has grown by approximately 2.9% YoY according to Similarweb (69.4 million in Q3/23 vs. 71.4 million in Q3/24). While this might not seem like a huge success at first glance, in the context of the company’s projected revenue decline of -10% to -5% YoY for Q3—and given that just a few quarters ago, Groupon was essentially headed toward a wall and almost certain death—this growth actually shows a trend reversal. The IT problems likely persist and may continue for some time due to the historically complex system, but the key takeaway is that if traffic is stabilizing or even growing slightly YoY, then management’s most optimistic outlook could be met, or possibly even exceeded.  **New frontend in the U.S. – better conversion rates likely**   Groupon recently launched a new frontend that was initially tested on a small sample of users in the U.S., yielding positive conversion results. Now, it seems that the new frontend has been rolled out across the entire U.S., so it’s reasonable to anticipate improved conversions, which should translate to higher revenue.  I’m not expecting a massive breakthrough, but rather that management is successfully executing their projections to stabilize the company’s cash flow and reverse the long decline in traffic. With the current share price at $10.33 and an expected EBITDA of $60–80 million, the **EBITDA multiple is just 5.1–6.8**. If their outlook is met on the high end or slightly exceeded, and if they project a 5-10% revenue growth for next year, then the current share price is very attractive. Within a reasonable timeframe of 1–2 years, there could be significant revaluation, with the **EBITDA multiple potentially expanding to 10–15x, coupled with organic EBITDA growth**. In addition, there’s a short-term speculative opportunity: a positive outlook could create pressure on short sellers to close positions, potentially driving the stock up in the short term.  **Conclusion and summary:**   With high short interest, traffic growth despite the expected decline, and a new, likely better-converting website in the U.S. (specifically in the Local segment, which is the company’s core business), Groupon’s situation may be far more optimistic than the market expects. Positive results could trigger a short squeeze in the short term, pushing the stock significantly higher.  What do you think? Thanks for your insights!

Even though revenue grew $1.5 billion, EPS took a big hit. $8.4 vs $9.7 ~ 20%. Not a good quarter. Share price dropped from 509 to 399 before semi recovering and hovering around 409-430.

The company is, in essence, becoming somewhat of a leveraged ETF for BTC with an extremely high entrance premium. So let’s talk about the effect of that and the stock price vs other strategies an investor could employ.**     **A.**      Volatility drag – Any leveraged product experiences volatility drag (also called volatility decay or beta slippage). Essentially, a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease in the product price (and the underlying price) will result in a lower net price than one started at. Therefore, the losses are amplified by the volatility drag.  **a.**       For example – one dollar increases in value by 10% to 1.10. Then due to the volatility of the dollar, it goes back down 10%. What you are left with is $0.99 rather than $1. This works in reverse as well (1 down to 0.9 then up to 0.99)  **b.**      What this means is that, the higher the volatility, the greater that volatility will decay your initial capital over time  **c.**       In the case of BTC, one of the most volatile holdings someone can include in their portfolio, a 2.5-3x leveraged product will experience 2.5-3x the losses from the swings that BTC will experience.  **i.      THIS IS WHY MSTR price is down 6.5% today while BTC is only down 1.7%**  **ii.**      All leveraged products experience this, which is why leveraged ETF’s are generally not meant to be held long term. The daily rebalancing of the ETF amplifies this decay.  **iii.**      MSTR is obviously not rebalanced daily, but the swings will drive up that decay in a big way  **B.**      The usual price pressures vs those on MSTR  **a.**       MSTR is being labeled as a leveraged ETF. However, leveraged ETF’s and ETF’s in general are subject to the price being heavily influenced by the iNAV rather than buying and selling pressures per se. (intraday net asset value)  **i.**      MSTR, however, is fully subject to the buying and selling pressures as it is a company, not an ETF.  **ii.**      This means that news that triggers a huge selloff can crush the stock price while the BTC it is supposedly tracking (and owning) remains high.  **iii.**      OF course those selling and buying pressures are also heavily influenced by the price of BTC.  So why is everyone enamoured with MSTR, driving the price up? My opinion is that Michael J. Saylor is an incredibly good salesman. He has been selling this so hard since starting bitcoin acquisition and has convinced you to give him money to buy BTC for the company instead of owning any yourself. He has also convinced you his company is better to hold than real BTC ETF’s such as **IBIT or the 2x leveraged BITX.** This simply doesn’t make sense given the numbers above. Bitcoin is the future, no doubt, but you own zero bitcoin by buying into MSTR, but are rather paying for a small amount of exposure. If the company went under tomorrow, despite the shares you own, you would see none of that BTC.  **Beyond that, Michael J. Saylor is an actual crook. He was found to have been filing fraudulent financial statements for MSTR in 2000, pumping the MSTR price. He was fined and disgorged. In June of this year, he reached a settlement with the AG for back-taxes. He had not paid taxes from 2005-2020. This alone is a reason I will never go long in this stock. He is selling you half empty glasses of future promises.**  [**https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-16829**](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-16829)  [**https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-secures-40-million**](https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-secures-40-million)  **As for me, I will be shorting this stock daily only, but likely through options rather than short sales due to the risk that short term volatility brings.

laikd0,"There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions.   **Why no spike today?**:  First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts.  All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER.  They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it. They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.  It might take just a few days, or weeks... But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price. That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.  We also know they’re down BAD. Why? Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.  So let’s see what tactics they are using:  **Short ladder attacks**:  What is a short ladder attack?  The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  Just look at the volume.

Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again.

People don’t seem to realize 3 things:  1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)  2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.  3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media.   SLV inverting GME:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.  **IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion.   **SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.  Silver squeeze not happening links:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly:   **Short Version:** The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.  There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.  On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).    Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~  **Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **  1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today). 2) Scroll all the way down the call list. 3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark). 4) Immediately exercise.  I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.  Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!  P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~  _Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.  _This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._  EDIT:  1) This works for pretty much any stock.  2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.  Example:  - $GME is $300 - The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000 - Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000). - Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)  After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,"{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': True, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}",True,False,False,False,34,1711,0,60,0,131,7,284,4.0,4.975352112676056
l7sx9e,"The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’  In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.  We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?  Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+.

We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it.

Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver.

le235t,"This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets       [I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)         [How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.         In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.          I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)         [This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)    So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.          Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.         With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

laferl,"Dear SEC and President Biden,  I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.   Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**  Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/   https://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png  (Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)  https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33 https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/  check this out  Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.  Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""     I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW.

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.  As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).  **Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**  In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.  **1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**  You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!  **2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**  If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).  **3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**  So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).  **4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**  Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.  So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.  P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎   Edit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \- so you can simply award his original post referenced.

This materialized as DAL and UAL continued their rally, with DAL up another 30% to 60 since my previous DD, primarily driven by US election results and the Trump Trade.    With the upcoming holiday season, tourism and air travel are at the top of mind – DAL and UAL are two domestic airlines best positioned on international, premium, and holiday travel. While UAL offers more INTL, DAL leads in premium and reliability, which are essential for vacation trips.   To get ahead of the holiday season, we aim to gain insight and forecast holiday travel demand and color on air travel going into 2025. With the recent election, recent MAR, ABNB, and EXPE earnings, and shifting macro trends, this post will focus more on forecasting and market dynamics rather than idiosyncrasies within the AI and DAL. We will project air travel demand and other factors affecting air travel and justify a bullish position on DAL going into Investor Day 2024 on 11/20.      Outline   * US Election Impact on Travel Demand, the Airline Industry (AI)  * Macro and industry trend implications for DAL  * MAR, ABNB, EXPE earnings and guidance implications for the AI  * Analysis of DAL's current positioning, performance, and upcoming catalysts  * My Positions   US Election, Trump Trade Impact on Airline Industry (AI)   Largely under the radar, the AI is part of the larger Trump Trade due to the following factors (https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-interest-rate-inflation-today-11-07-2024/card/heard-on-the-street-trump-makes-airlines-great-again-but-why--F7MJW5QDNenQ6RoKscio)   * Green light for M&A (Spirit and JetBlue) to transform the AI landscape  * Deregulation for AI, 2016 precedent  * Falling energy and oil prices with increased US production, 2016 precedent  * Ending wars in Ukraine, the Middle East part of 2024 campaign promise  * Fiscal policy to boost economy and both consumer and corporate spending, driving air travel demand  * Tariffs and other fiscal policy to strengthen the dollar, boosting INTL travel (https://www.marcus.com/us/en/resources/heard-at-gs/what-a-strong-us-dollar-means-for-travel)      Macro and Industry Trends Continue to Favor Airlines  - FED, EXPE earnings, ABNB earnings  * Cutting interest rates globally to boost economic activity continuing into the foreseeable future a tailwind for high-leverage industries such as the AI  * EXPE air revenue up 4% YoY in Q3 compared to 0% in Q2 and 1.7% in Q1, highlighting positive trends  * EXPE air bookings up 7.8% YoY in Q3, compared to 6.6% in Q2 and 1.4% in Q1  * EXPE cited strong air bookings as a main driver for Q3 performance  * EXPE raises FY24 outlook, citing growth and opportunities abroad despite previous travel demand concerns  * EXPE total B2C revenue down 1.4% YoY in Q3 more than offset by 18.4% B2B revenue increase YoY  * Mild B2C Q3 revenue decrease does signal travel softness, but combined with air revenue increase strengthens thesis for increasing shift to longer distance, INTL vacation travel  * ABNB earnings gives insight into travel demand, global  * ABNB Q3 revenue up 10% YoY  * Strong performance in core markets (US, Canada, Australia, UK, France) represents 75% of business  * Sees strong opportunity in expansion into other global markets, bullish sign for INTL travel  * ABNB performance less informative than EXPE on the AI      Current DAL Performance, Positioning, and Upcoming Catalysts   DAL and UAL are industry leaders well-positioned for the upcoming holiday travel season. I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:  * DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total  * Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown)  * Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue  * Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends  * Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends  * Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers  * AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop  * CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20  * Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends  * Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively?  * Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins  * Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections    Throughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3). As a tangent: potential upcoming trade opportunity will be comparing actual TSA check-in data during the winter months and trade off the spread between current AI optimism on Q4 travel and modeling what the actual data represents.   My Positions:   * 45 Jan25 $55 Calls  * 100 Jan25 $60 Calls  * 150 Jan 25 $70 Calls  * Total position: 100k in Jan25 options   tldr; who needs NVDA when you have the secret AI (airline industry) trade, already turned 4 bagger trading airlines but I plan on riding this plane to the moon right behind Elon","Bullish DAL – High Travel Demand to Continue Driving the Other AI (Airline Industry) Trade, 100k Options Position ","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': False, 'negation_match': True}","{'additive_match': False, 'transitive_match': False, 'symmetric_match': True, 'negation_match': True}",False,True,False,False,114,6135,3,147,4,289,18,903,5.333333333333333,5.710963455149502
1glgzkk,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling.   Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)  I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done.   Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech.

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter.

1gkgqx3,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**  **Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.  **No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers.   **SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….  >  **Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.  **Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America.   **Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.  **Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.  **A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.  **Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different  The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.  The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books.
