1glx7j4,"$TOST is probably something that will have boring earnings, but I'm going to play it anyway.",1,"I'm not one for long, drawn-out DD's with oodles of scribbles on graphs, so here's the quick and dirty:

* $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet.
* $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open.
* $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.

I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow. If it's an earning miss, then we're likely looking at a similar fall of 5%, but I feel it will still add some recovery on Friday/Monday. Price target of $34-$35 after earnings, and if earnings are good, $42-$44 by EOY.

The company I work for got bought out by PFGC. I now have the choice to by stock options at a 15% discount at 1%-15% of my POST TAX income. I believe this is replacing my current 401k program which I currently have maxed out. All my extra income goes into a brokerage account for SPY (I know I should get a ROTH IRA, I’ll do it one day…maybe?). I’m just a normal wagie, I made some stock picks in the past before, some winners, mostly losers. I’m smart enough to know I’m not smart in stock picks.

My question is:
Do I take advantage of the stock options program? Do I max out the contribution rate?

If you were to buy and hold the 10k you're portfolio would basically follow the stock price. Pretty straightforward.

But what if you sell when it drops a certain level and buy when it increases a certain level. Say -5% & +10% rule. Here's the catch, you don't sell and buy the whole portfolio you sell just the part that you gained and ""reinvest"".

1glrz84,🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀,362,"**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.

**Why the New Japan Deal Matters**

Archer's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.

**Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**

ACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.

**Key Graphs to Watch**

* **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure.
* **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same.
* **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector.
* **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.

**Final Thoughts**

Archer is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.

1glmw02,Core-satellite split between regular and retirement brokerages?,2,"I've been investing in global ETFs like S&P500 and MSCI ACWI so far.

1glletv,ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term),6,"ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+€ to 610€ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 € yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 € PUTs with December 20th expiry.

1glgzkk,Recommendations for Lower Risk Investment Strategies - Buffer Savings for Payroll for my Business,7,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling. 

Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)

I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done. 

Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech. 

I've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years.

Reddit is Yelp, it’s Craigslist/Facebook marketplace, it’s $PINS and more. It’s generally promoted as every search result on Google and it’s a place where nearly all of my circle uses it for conversation when attempting to find answers. You regards use it to light literally all your money on fire and advertisers are starting to do the same thing. 

Most users are in USA, so explosive growth is there for the taking outside of the USA. They haven’t totally monetized their ads model yet, and their paid search is on the way. They’re also driving more ads into threads. 

Because Reddit users follow their most important interests, and interact with them directly, it’s also one of the most targeted ways to serve ads. 

So why isn’t this company worth $51b or nearly $340/share in two years at a 15x?

Is the bear case really “it’s a bot driven site” and share based compensation?

They also have untapped potential in training LLM models, 1 billion in organic search, etc.

1glf4c3,$QXO: The Brad Jacobs Freight Train You’re All Sleeping On,7,"Regards,

Listen up - here’s the deal on QXO. I’m not here to give you some penny stock pitch that’s gonna end with you crying to your bank. I’m talking Brad Jacobs—a name that actually commands respect in business. He took XPO from being small fry to a $15 billion freight monster, and now he’s back for another round. But let’s be real, if you’re looking for some pump-and-dump garbage, this ain’t for you.

The Big Picture: Owning a $1 Trillion Industry
Jacobs doesn’t mess around. He’s here to take over the building products distribution market, which is a trillion-dollar industry begging for a savior to come in and shake it up. When he took on XPO, the logistics industry was a hot mess of inefficiency and disarray. Fast-forward a decade, and XPO is a name every freight guy knows. Now he’s got his sights set on QXO, and this isn’t for some pocket change. This is a takeover.

$5 Billion Cash Stash and No Debt—No Chains Holding QXO Back
Unlike all those broke startups praying for investor mercy, QXO has $5 billion in cold, hard cash with zero debt. That’s right—no loans, no strings, no BS holding them back. They’re not out here begging for quarters; they’re ready to buy, expand, and roll out a carpet of domination.

Why does that matter? Because QXO doesn’t need to play games. They’re stacked with cash, ready to make moves that’ll put smaller players in the rearview. Jacobs isn’t here to gamble; he’s here to grab the industry by the throat, and he’s got the war chest to do it.

The Kushner Factor – Like It or Not
Here’s something juicy for the conspiracy theorists: Jared Kushner is on the board. Yeah, some of you might hate him, but this guy’s got connections up to his eyeballs. And those connections come with cash. His firm, Affinity Partners, dropped a fat $150 million into QXO. Don’t like it? Too bad. Kushner’s network isn’t here to make friends; it’s here to get things done, open doors, and give QXO a reach into corners you don’t even know exist.

When you’re trying to flip a trillion-dollar market on its head, having someone with global influence doesn’t hurt. Kushner might not be your buddy, but trust me, he’s good for business.

Jacobs’ Legacy: The Guy Knows How to Print Money
Listen up, because this isn’t some snake oil show. Jacobs’ track record is rock solid. This guy has pulled off business miracles before, and he doesn’t deal in hype—he deals in results. When he took on XPO, he didn’t just win; he redefined the game. XPO is now a giant, and Jacobs is ready to do the same with QXO.

So, if you’re waiting for him to stumble, keep waiting. Jacobs’ whole career has been about taking scrappy underdogs and turning them into business beasts. Now he’s taking everything he knows and throwing it into QXO. If you can’t see the potential, maybe stick to meme stocks.

The Stock Split Debacle – Here’s What Actually Happened
Ah, the infamous 1-for-8 reverse split. Yeah, that was a bit of a ride, but let me break it down for you: this wasn’t some sneaky “oh no, we’re failing” move. This was QXO setting itself up to be taken seriously by institutional investors. The split pushed the price up, making QXO look less like a penny stock and more like a heavyweight. But some of you lost your minds when it hit $235 on June 10th and the market cap skyrocketed to $90 billion. Did QXO magically become worth as much as Amazon overnight? No, don’t be dumb.

Here’s what went down: because of the share structure change, there were way fewer shares out there for the taking. The supply got tighter than a drum, so naturally, the price shot up, and platforms didn’t adjust fast enough. It was a hiccup. The market cap was basically a mirage, not a problem with the company. If you panicked, that’s on you, not QXO.

Since then, it’s settled down to a more reasonable $15.25 as of today. This isn’t volatility due to bad business. It’s due to mechanics. QXO still has the same cash pile, no debt, and Jacobs at the helm. If you got weak knees over a glitch in the system, you’re not cut out for this play.

QXO’s Under the Radar – and Underpriced
Here’s the deal: the market’s napping on QXO. Despite the players on board, this stock is still low-key. People are too busy betting on whatever’s hyped that day. But if you can look past the nonsense, this is one of the most undervalued plays you’ll find. Don’t believe me? Look at Trump’s election. QXO didn’t budge. No hype, no pump—it’s steady because it’s built for the long haul.

This isn’t a meme stock. It’s not chasing clout. It’s positioning for a colossal win that takes years, not days. If you don’t have the patience, keep walking.

For the Diamond Hands Only
If you’re here for a 3-day flip, leave now. QXO isn’t for the paper-handed. This is a stock for people who see the big picture, who understand that building value takes time. Brad Jacobs has done it before, and he’s doing it again. You want in? Then you’re here for the ride, no whining allowed. In a few years, QXO will be leading in building products, and the weak hands will be nowhere to be found.

So keep chasing those meme plays if that’s your thing, but for the real players—the ones who see Jacobs’ vision—QXO is one of the few long-term buys that could actually make you rich.

1gldduj,I was early and wrong so you don't have to be $COIN,24,"I went all in on Coinbase shortly after IPO in 2021 around $300/share, with a very loose thesis, ""I don't get it but probably it will keep going up""

Total investment around that time was $100k shares.

The stock fell, chopped, rebounded and then fell some more all the way to $35. During the long painful bear market my conviction in the company grew due to actually understanding the technology, it's potential, and Coinbase's strategy. I sold my shares and bought leap calls, (quite some time before the actual $35 bottom), I ended up closing a loss of $80k. I rolled into new leaps, bought the dip, and was locked in to the industry news. Every time I thought about walking away I just couldn't because ""the industry has never looked more promising than it does today"".

It would be easy not to notice if you weren't paying attention, but the rate at which products are shipping, and builder culture is growing is just incredible, and in large part thanks to the Coinbase team, especially Jessie, the founder of their etherium layer 2 Base. 

Anyway, come oct 2023, things are looking pretty bullish and it's smooth sailing for my portfolio from ~$20k low to $450k at the March top of this year. Incredible, but the blow off top wasn't ready. So I rode that all the way back down to $90k, rolling as necessary, and buying the dip. 

Well, now here we are following the Trump election, the most pro crypto Congress ever (250+ pro crypto candidates elected to the house and 16 to the Senate), Trump is going to remove Gensler, which you don't need the whole story but Gensler has been a major thorn in the side of the crypto industry. 

It's also been ~6 months since the Bitcoin halfing, which, if you believe the technical folks, they say is about the correct amount of time to start seeing a supply squeeze affect Bitcoin prices. We also just broke all time high on BTC, entering price discovery. 

Here is the most stupid simple trade of your life, and congratulations, you didn't have to trudge through the mud for 4 years like I did (I'm a moron). 

Coinbase historically tracks BTC  with 2-3x more reactivity (as a percentage), but in the past 6 months it has deviated, see attached image.
My hypothesis, is that Coinbase is going to play catch-up with BTC, with a short term exponential move (we saw the start of this today Coin up 30% vs BTC up 2%). Once Coinbase is back on parity, it should resume it's 2-3x outperformance on the rally.

BTC is going up, I have three rough targets for Feb 25:
Bear: $100k-120k, $400-600 COIN
Base: $120-150k, $600-800 COIN
Bull: $150-250k, $800-$1500 COIN

1glceac,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,78,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

**2. Tarriffs and EV Tax credits**

EV Tax credits are definitely going bye bye which is bullish for Tesla since now more companies are going to bleed money like crazy until you realize the only selling point of a Tesla is you get a 7500 dollar tax credit, now it will just be a 45k+ luxury vehicle for most people.

Who pays for the 40 billion dollars? Not china, shareholders do meaning the entire company is devalued by 40 billion dollars.

1gl9i2e,E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,97,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Anyway, my credit cards will be paid off very quickly when I start the new job becuase of the salary increase but I will not be able to participate in the firm’s 401k for a year.

1gl69j8,Trump win Bullish or Bearish for GOLD?,0,"Gold has had a pretty good rally up until recently. You think it'll keep going up and break ATH now that Trump won or will the pattern reverse?

Trump’s previous term did see significant fluctuations in gold prices, influenced by both his policies and larger market trends. Some analysts argue that Trump’s stance on fiscal policy, especially around trade and spending, could create an environment where gold thrives. If somehow there’s renewed uncertainty or if inflation concerns rise, gold could benefit from that risk-averse sentiment.

On the other hand, if he sticks to his word and stops the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, then the new ""peaceful climate"" could cause gold prices to drop, as gold is seen as a safe haven asset that people flock to during economic and geopolitical turmoil.

The recent rally has been strong, and some traders are starting to worry about whether the price is sustainable. A correction wouldn’t be unusual, especially if markets start factoring in potential stability or if there’s a push toward riskier assets. Additionally, interest rates can play a huge role in gold prices. If there’s a shift toward higher rates, we might see downward pressure on gold as investors turn to interest-bearing assets.

At this point, it feels like a coin toss. The key factors to watch will be any policy announcements from Trump, how markets react in the coming months, and of course, global economic conditions.

1. Fundamentals Are Turning Around 📈: Corsair’s core business has seen a lot of improvements, with demand stabilizing after the pandemic highs and lows. The company’s gaming peripherals and PC components are still flying off the shelves, and they’re expanding into new product categories. They’ve streamlined operations, reduced overhead, and positioned themselves to be cash flow positive in the coming quarters.

2. Partnership with Call of Duty 🎮: Corsair just locked in a partnership with Call of Duty, which brings them closer to the gaming community than ever. This move isn’t just a branding gimmick – it’s a strategic alignment with one of the most iconic franchises in gaming, which could give Corsair a strong edge in the competitive esports and streaming markets. COD players and streamers are hardcore about their setups, and Corsair’s gear has a loyal following among them.

3. Strong Product Portfolio 💻: From high-performance gaming keyboards to streaming gear, Corsair has all the toys gamers want, and they keep innovating. Gaming and streaming aren’t just trends – they’re part of the new way we live and entertain. Corsair is doubling down, which is exactly what we want to see in the long term.

I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I’m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?

I’ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I’ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they’ll probably go up again in the future. However, I’m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs

Any thoughts on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gl4brb/what_are_your_expectations_for_greenrenewable/,investing,"FAN, I, TAN"
1gl4aww,Gold/oz down as predicted.,0,"I have been timing the market for over 10 years. Elsewhere and earlier I predicted gold per ounce would go down, my thesis was that miners (GOLD:Barrick and NEM:Newmont) usually front run gold price. There can be multiple factors in figuring the price of a miner, oil and copper are usually the big externalities.

Copper price will make a mine more profitable, usually.  
Oil will add to cost.

I assessed a couple weeks ago that it was unlikely that oil cost would become excessive, having been much higher in the last year when gold was a lower price, and that copper is in a lull. I'm bullish both copper and oil.

Thus I concluded that gold miners were front running the gold price.

My target was the 20 weekly; we are only at the 50daily. But I think we will hit the 20 weekly in which case I'll start to buy gold miners or I'll buy gold outright.

  
Gold makes up about 68% of my portfolio; so I've been selling covered calls on GLD to finance holding the asset which is considered to have a ""negative yield"". I generate about 3% dividend yearly from this strategy buy-hold.

So Gold has historically been my ""buy forever"" from selling profits elsewhere. I think after this run though we will see a 10+ year gold bear market. This is due to the ""behavior of money"". Money behaves a certain way in money markets. Gold will top out somewhere near $4,000 est. and then it'll enter a long bear market. Gold has done this 3 times before since the early 1970s. So there's no reason to think it's not a mechanical reality in a delicate balance of interest rate parities, currency availability and liquidity globally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gl4aww/goldoz_down_as_predicted/,investing,"I, NEM, GOLD, GLD"

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

~~That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.~~

~~That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.~~

What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks.

1gly6hr,Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point,18,"**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html)

*The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy.*
  

  
*In a follow-up to September’s big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.*
  

  
*Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first “no” vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision.*
  

  
*The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market.*
  
*“The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the document stated, a change from September when it noted “greater confidence” in the process.*
  
*Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much a priority as arresting inflation.*
  
*On the labor market, the statement said “conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The committee again said the economy “has continued to expand at a solid pace.“*
  
*Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank’s 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of “recalibrating” policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation.*
  
*Powell will answer questions about the decision at his 2:30 news conference. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the presidential election.*
  
*There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households.*
  
*Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the Q2 level but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed.*
  
*Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.*
  
*The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop.*
  
*President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday’s election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong.*
  
*Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair’s term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead.*
  
*An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts.*
  
*Questions have arisen over what the “terminal” point is for the Fed, or the point at which it will decide it has cut enough and has its benchmark rate where it is neither pushing nor holding back growth. Traders expect the Fed likely will approve another quarter-point cut in December then pause in January as it assesses the impact of its tightening moves, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.*
  
*The FOMC indicated in September that members expected a half percentage point more in cuts by the of this year and then another full percentage point in 2025.*
  
*The September “dot plot” of individual officials’ expectations pointed to a terminal rate of 2.9%, which would imply another half percentage point of cuts in 2026.*
  
*Even with the Fed lowering rates, markets have not responded in kind.*
  
*Treasury yields have jumped higher since the September cut, as have mortgage rates. The 30-year mortgage, for instance, has climbed about 0.7 percentage point to 6.8%, according to Freddie Mac. The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost as much.*
  
*The Fed is seeking to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy in which it can bring down inflation without causing a recession. The Fed’s preferred inflation indicator most recently showed a 2.1% 12-month rate, though the so-called core, which excludes food and energy and is generally considered a better long-run indicator, was at 2.7%.*

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

1gkxptd,"Toyota posts nearly 20% drop in second-quarter operating profit, missing estimates",364,"Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price rises.
* There is a 97.4% chance of a 25 bp rate cut for this upcoming Fed meeting tomorrow, Nov. 7th. which would already meet the 75 bp cut that SoFi's CEO has predicted for this year to facilitate SoFi's rapid growth.

I am writing this post in this subreddit because I have noticed that the quality of the comments is a bit better compared to most other subreddits out there.

One thing that has been bothering me for some time now is the steady rise of the Shiller P/E ratio of the S&P 500. It has remained excessively high for a very long time and has basically only gone up after 2009 with very brief periods of correction.

Is this caused by the rising popularity of ETF investing or is there a bigger problem out there ?

The market is becoming more and more expensive every year. This makes it harder and harder to find a fairly-valued company to invest in and it raises concerns over future returns in general.

What do you attribute the rise of the Shiller P/E to and do you feel concerned or is it not something that is bothering you ?

1gkjlaq,Vanguard deposes BlackRock as provider of world’s second-largest ETF,225,"Inflows to VOO look set to smash records as observers predict it will soon overtake SPY to become the biggest

Vanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.

In a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.

“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year. In contrast, SPY has seen $5bn in outflows. The $125bn gap between the two ETFs [VOO and SPY] has shrunk to under $50bn in 2024. Were that pace to continue, VOO would easily be crowned king in 2025.”

&#x200B;

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**
  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*
  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*
  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*
  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*
  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*
  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*
  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*
  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*
  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*
  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*
  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*
  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*
  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*
  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*
  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*
  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*
  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*
  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*
  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*
  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk7fz6/musk_now_says_its_pointless_to_build_a_25000/,stocks,"Y, U, I, X, EV, S"

1gl3rir,Is Trump’s Return a Bullish or Bearish Signal for Real Estate in 2024? Buy the dip on Real Estate ? or NOOOO ??? ,0,"(""If"") Trump makes a comeback in 2024, his policies could have mixed effects on the real estate market.

On one hand, deregulation could boost housing supply by easing construction processes.

On the other hand, his track record of driving up interest rates to manage the budget deficit might make mortgages more expensive and dampen buyer demand.

His push for privatizing entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also hike mortgage rates further, reducing affordability.

So, while we could see more homes being built, it could become harder for average buyers to afford them. Thoughts?

1gl2dp1,Follow-Up Post on Earnings Day: $IONQ Set for a Massive Rally with Multiple Catalysts Ahead,39,"**TL;DR:** Still long $IONQ on earnings day and not planning to sell anytime soon. Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.  
  
**Ticker:** $IONQ  
**Industry:** Computer Hardware  
**Current Price:** $16.35

A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.

I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.

All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.

# Sources I recommend:

* Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them.
* Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs.
* Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption.
* IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.

# Revenue Growth and Business Progress

After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.

https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55

This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.

Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.

Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.

https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0

Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.

https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289

With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.

# Business Applications

I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.

This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.

https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe

Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.

https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78

https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1

It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.

The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.

# Options Chain

I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.

https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973

# Institutional and Government Interest

In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.

Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.

# Competitors

For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.

IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.

https://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0

# Bear Thesis

The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.

Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.

But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?

I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.

# Founders

I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.

It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.

# Conclusion

That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gl2dp1/followup_post_on_earnings_day_ionq_set_for_a/,wallstreetbets,"FOMO, DR, OTM, USA, IIA, CNBC, I, LEAPS, TL, IONQ, CEO, ARLIS, DD, AI, EPS, A"

Obviously, the last month or so rates have jumped, with ETF values dropping, and now Trump getting elected has the yield on treasuries spiking even more drastically.

There is talk that this is due to the assumption Trump will spend more, cut taxes, etc and it seems generally that the sentiment is US debt will therefore be seen as higher risk. I know corporate bonds pretty much track US treasury yields, but at some point will these diverge and good quality corporate debt will be less tied to the US risk-free rate?

Harris trade strategy: Call Gold + Call Silver + Put USD + Put crude oil --> Horizon call 3 month OTM

I don't agree with this table and this is my opinion:

If Mr Trump is elected, I see a good reaction from the stock market (especially in the US) thanks to his support for the ""US first"" mentality.

Furthermore, He will create big barriers (tariffs) against Chinese products and companies that could be ""profitable"" for the US stock market.

Regarding the commodities and FX market (USD), the confidence in Trump's economic plan thanks to his previous mandate and his current campaign, the DXY (USD) index will strengthen his position.

As a result of the reinforcement of the DXY and negative correlation, we'll see weaknesses in precious metals (XAUUSD & XAGUSD).

Also, If Trump is elected, we obviously will see a strong crypto Bullmarket 

Finally, If Madam Harris is elected, her economic plan could strengthen the position of the United States in international trade (with China) and, therefore, perhaps weaken the USD against the rising power of the BRICS.

1gkh810,How to Reconcile Portfolio Performance Cash Balance with IBKR without Skewing IRR?,2,"Hey everyone! I’m trying to get an accurate view of my portfolio performance, but I’m stuck on one detail: tracking external bank fees (like the fee I pay to transfer funds into my brokerage account). Here’s my situation:

When I deposit money into my IBKR account, I pay a bank fee (e.g., 5 EUR) that’s deducted before the funds even arrive at IBKR. This fee doesn’t impact my IBKR balance but is a real cost of moving money into my portfolio. I’m wondering:

1. **Is it even necessary to include this external bank fee in my IRR calculation?** My goal is to see my net returns accurately?
2. **If it is needed, does anyone know of a portfolio tracker that can handle this?** Ideally, I’d like an app (preferably open-source) that lets me track these fees without reducing my brokerage account balance, yet still considers them in performance metrics like IRR.

I currently use Portfolio Performance, but it doesn’t allow for this specific kind of adjustment.

Would love to hear any insights on whether this fee tracking is necessary for an accurate view of returns and if there’s an app that can handle it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gkh810/how_to_reconcile_portfolio_performance_cash/,investing,"I, IRR, IBKR, EUR"

1gkgqx3,Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,78,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

1gkgi1o,Pie Structure for Long Term Returns,0,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a diversified, aggressive ETF portfolio structure aimed at maximizing long-term returns (20+ years) while managing risk just enough to keep it sustainable through market cycles. I wanted to share my current thinking, and I’d love to hear your critiques, especially from those with experience in building out long-term portfolios.

50% in U.S. Large-Cap (S&P 500), using an ETF like Vanguard S&P 500 (VUAG).

30% in Global Equity (ex-U.S.), with an option like Vanguard FTSE All-World (VWRP) to diversify beyond the U.S.

10% in Emerging Markets, such as Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets, for higher growth potential from developing economies.

5% in U.S. Small-Cap Growth, like iShares U.S. Small-Cap Growth, for exposure to high-growth U.S. small companies.

5% in Global Small-Cap, using an ETF like Vanguard Global Small-Cap for international small-cap diversification.

Why I chose these ETF's? 

- Aggressive and Diversified: This portfolio is 100% equities for maximum growth, spread globally across U.S., international, emerging markets, and small caps.


- Growth with Stability: Large-cap stocks add stability, while small caps and emerging markets boost growth potential, balancing risk over the long term.


- U.S.-Focused with Global Reach: A 50% allocation to U.S. stocks leverages strong historical returns, while 30% in international equities adds diversification beyond the U.S.


What Do You Think?!

I’d love to get feedback on the approach, especially any ideas for fine tuning or managing long term risk without sacrificing too much growth.

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter.

By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales.

Position: 311 nov 15 $2.50 calls

Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.

EDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.

Feel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock. Plus

1gkbxex,The Big(ger) Short: The Case for April 2025 Puts on iShares CMBS ETF ,97,"Everyone on this sub has seen The Big Short; its practically a prerequisite to trading market derivatives (and losing lots of money doing it). I think its safe to say that everyone has that fantasy that they get in on the ground floor of a trend that no one else could have seen coming. So I'm here to offer my explanation and pitch for why CMBS $44 4/17 puts are going to print money in a matter of time
I think a lot of people are vaguely aware that there has been some trouble in the commercial real estate market since remote work took off during COVID, but I think few people are aware of just how bad the issue has stayed. Despite some return to office, absurd markdown rates have become Extremely common.
Now how does this tie into CMBS? Well - CMBS works exactly the way that mortgage backed securities did in 2008 - a tranche of mortgages is packaged together, and ideally, that CMBS becomes worth more over time as the loan is paid back. Herein lies the problem - when these buildings are being sold at pennies on the dollar, even up into the present day, this presents a serious distress problem. And herein lies in my evidence that we are on the cusp of an epic collapse in the CMBS market:


Office CMBS Delinquency Rate
This graph, sourced by Trepp and published by Wolf Street Yesterday (Nov. 4) is currently showing that there is an epic blowup happening in the Office CMBS delinquency rate. Mind you, this is PRE RECESSION. The S&P is up gambling numbers (~23%) this year, and the delinquency rate is still skyrocketing as of yesterday. If there is any impending weakness in the economy - or even pullback to normalcy after an insane year of bull run - this delinquency rate is likely to completely blow by historical volatility markers.

For the play - I have 18 contracts of 4/18 CMBS $44. The premiums are pretty low because the historical volatility is almost nonexistent, but I think given this evidence there is a chance that it could greatly surpass these markers - and be an extremely profitable play.

Is this by any means guaranteed? Absolutely not, the market could continue to rip ass into the sunset and the commercial real estate market pulls out with zero problems. But given the current trends, and the fact that the current bull market cannot last forever, I think this is a serious play with some potential for some serious upside. Plus, who doesn't want to be the one who called it?

1gkbipd,How will inflate your debt away work in a country like US?,0,"I am trying to figure out if long term bonds are worth the risk in case future govt in collusion with Fed decides to keep rates low even if inflation is high.

Can anyone write play by play like how it may happen. I am going to try first below:

1. Say in 2025 inflation is still above 2.6% and economic activity points to strong labor market and GDP growth of 3% but still congress approves tax cuts for everyone at the cost of deficit. They also approve infrastructure projects costing trillions in deficit. But Fed continues to cut rates. Fed helps the govt fund it's deficit by buying treasury bonds if demand is low considering real yield is zero or negative.
2. Inflation goes much higher due to higher spending by businesses and consumers but Fed does not raise rates.
3. Say they tolerate inflation upto 5-6% while keeping short term rates at 3% or lower and forcing long term treasury rate below 4% because of fed buying them.

This will have the effect of debt being discounted every year by 2-3% just like how it has happened between 2020 to 2023.

1gkamqv,The top five most crowded deals right now,0,"Specifically, going long USD, DJT, Bitcoin and some thematic stocks in US equities and shorting US bonds has been the most crowded general election trade over the past period.
Currently, 10-year US bond yields have rallied about 70bp from their stage lows, the US dollar has also rallied 3.3% from its lows, bitcoin has retreated after hitting all-time highs last week, and bank and clean energy stocks have risen and fallen about 5%, respectively, over the last month, but the moves both reversed on Monday, and DJT is up more than 180% since its lows.
U.S. bond yields public information, Trump's economic advocacy is expected to significantly increase the federal deficit, or rekindle the U.S. “reflation risk”, so Trump's election theoretically put pressure on U.S. bonds, supporting the dollar strength.
As the probability of a Trump victory heated up in recent weeks, the 10-year U.S. bond yields climbed rapidly, and is now at 4.314%, a cumulative upward movement of about 70bp since the lows of September 16, almost wiping out the cumulative decline since June.
Dollar In addition to the inflation risks that could come with a higher deficit, Trump's aggressive tariff policy ideas could also boost the dollar to some extent.
Economists say a sharp increase in import tariffs would cause U.S. consumers to spend less on imported goods, which in turn would push the dollar higher.
The dollar has moved roughly in line with the 10-year U.S. bond yield, which has seen a strong wave of gains since October and is now at 103.74 after a strong 3.3 percent rally since its Sept. 27 low.
Bitcoin contrasts with Biden's crackdown on the crypto industry, as both Trump and Harris have taken a supportive stance on crypto assets, with Trump previously vowing to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world”.
Bitcoin, which has been on a broad swing for nearly six months, has risen a cumulative 27.3 percent in the last three months, hitting a new all-time high last week but quickly falling back below $70,000 to $68,800 per coin.
Clean Energy Stocks and Bank Stocks Some traders expect Trump to eliminate the Biden administration's tax incentives for clean energy if he is in the White House, which would weigh heavily on clean energy stocks, while there's also a view that Harris could hit bank stocks if she's elected as she advocates for higher corporate taxes and more financial regulation.
Half a year, the Nasdaq Bank Index cumulative rise of more than 15%, BlackRock Global Clean Energy ETF is a cumulative decline of more than 3%, in the past month is up and down about 5%, respectively, on Monday, the trend of both a reversal, the Nasdaq Bank Index fell more than 1% during the day, BlackRock Global Clean Energy ETF is more than 2% intraday rise.
Trump Media & Technology Group Individual Shares (DJT) As Trump's major media and technology holding, Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) can be considered a “purebred Trump concept stock,” and is the most direct option for investors betting on a Trump victory.
Analysts say DJT 's stock price is unrelated to company fundamentals and can be viewed as a meme stock, given that the company is virtually unprofitable at the performance level.
Last week, in the retail buying driven by the explosion, DJT intraday five times triggered a meltdown stop, since the low point of September 23rd since the strong rebound of more than 182.6%, so far this year its share price almost doubled, the current market capitalization has exceeded the New York Times",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gkamqv/the_top_five_most_crowded_deals_right_now/,wallstreetbets,"US, USD, S, ETF, DJT, U"

I am probably uneducated when it comes to tarrifs and that side of economy but how will they, if Trump gets elected, affect a company like Amazon, of which I have a position in. I know he plans to raise taxes by 60% for products produced in China for the American companies importing them. My worry is that Amazons ""retail seller"" (whatever you want to call it) side is going to suffer quite heavily, since about 70% of the stuff sold on Amazon is from China. 

How will Amazon respond to something like this? How soon is it predicted for these tariffs to come into place, if he is elected? I wasn't able to find too much specifically about Amazon, and since I'm from Sweden it doesn't really come up in conversation with friends.

Almost all of them come to the conclusion that the future of SoFi looks solid and are expecting consistent growth especially after recent earnings and guidance for the upcoming years. 

IMO - If you think about it, there are so many reasons why SoFi is a company that could continue to thrive in the future even after the massive 50% increase in october.

Besides reasons like “analyst manipulation” or “big bank manipulation” that I have heard from a few folks, are there any further reasons I'm missing that lead to these bad analyst forecasts? I can't imagine that SoFi is under their radar...  October was too good of a month to still ignore the stock.

1gk65u0,EF Hutton sets 30$ price target for ImmunityB,9,"IBRX, a biotech company developing novel cancer treatments, has been valued at $30 per share in a coverage initiation report by EF Hutton, an investment bank. The bank’s target price for ImmunityBio is more than seven times the October 24 close.

EF Hutton analyst **Jason Kolbert** has set a target price of $30 per share for ImmunityBio, for upside of over 600% and representing the highest target price on Wall Stree

>

ImmunityBio is developing new treatments for cancer and infectious diseases. It was founded in 2014 by Dr. **Patrick Soon-Shiong**, who has investigated mechanisms to activate the immune system to attack tumors for the last two decades. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved ImmunityBio’s first drug, Anktiva, for BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer in adults. The company claims that 30–40% of patients fail to respond to the widely used BCG treatment, while half of those who initially responded see a recurrence.

ImmunityBio is currently conducting 27 clinical trials across 13 indications, including studying Anktiva for non-small-cell lung cancer and a vaccine for certain types of cancer. EF Hutton’s Kolbert sees particular promise in Anktiva’s ability to convert cold tumors into hot ones. Hot tumors have more immune cells, meaning the immune system can more effectively detect and attack them, while cold tumors have fewer immune cells. Kolbert believes that ImmunityBio’s therapy could potentially improve treatment outcomes by making “cold-tumor” cancers, like glioblastoma, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, more vulnerable to an immune system attack.

1gk58jr,Burger King parent Restaurant Brands falls short of Q3 revenue expectations,38,"Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as domestic same-store sales growth for all four of its chains fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

1gk57du,Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,119,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

SiriusXM has more users than Spotify when including Pandora and is sitting rather undervalued ie. Warren Buffet takes advantage. And he’s picky. Something appears to be cooking. Acquisition target? Cause the ER wasn’t that good and he’s not really the yolo’ing kind is he?

Keep in mind the recent reverse split. You don’t want to buy those cause that’s the pennystock playbook. However, in rare cases prior to an acquisition it may be a term for the acquisition itself to take place.

Ex-date is today Nov 5 and I’ve heard something about FTD’s outstanding. Can anyone confirm?
I’m not saying it will go to the moon and not before a 30% drop. Maybe it’s too obvious to happen idk. Or maybe we’re supposed to think it’s too obvious to happen so we’re like “naah” and then when it happens we’re like “God damn it I knew it!”. 

Either way I see it as a stamp of approval and I started a small position Friday in the PM. I hope it’ll drop honestly. I’d like a larger position in this particular case. And Yesterday it did drop so I’ve added a little bit more.
Not easy to find a good management and Warren Buffet is known for his and Charlie Munger’s need to like a company’s management and the way they run the business.

>The Kyoto-based gaming company sold 4.7 million Switch consoles in the first half of the financial year, down from 6.8 million units in the same period a year earlier.

>Nintendo lowered its full-year sales forecast for the console, which is in its eighth year on the market, by 7% to 12.5 million units. That would be down 20% from actual Switch sales of 15.7 million units a year earlier.

>It also revised down its annual software sales forecast by 3% to 160 million units.

>Furukawa said there was no change to Nintendo's plan to announce a successor to its long-lasting Switch console in the current financial year to March, but did not go into specifics.

1gk0wsl,""" Boeing workers vote to accept deal, end strike """,273,"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/business/boeing-strike-vote-hnk-intl/index.html


New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.
What do you think?
View Comments

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

1gk0l1n,My market memoirs during the COVID 19 pandemic and the resultant market turmoil,18,"I have lived through three significant financial turmoil in my adult life time and I would like to share my learning with fellow retail traders. Most people know that there is the traditional steady path to prosperity or there are these opportunities that come ones in a lifetime that the lucky one gets to ride and get rich quick, like really quick.

Back in 1998, I had just started taking interest in share market. There was no easy access to internet back then where I lived.  I would read any documents or books or periodicals I could get my hands on to understand how things work. I experienced the era of unreliable dial up internet connection, but I invested a huge sum of money to buy my first Personal Computer in the early 90s and would surf the internet looking for information on investments.

Living through the turmoil of the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapse in 1998, the disaster of the 2008 financial crisis, and the global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has profoundly shaped the world of investments and the stock market. These crises, while devastating for many, have also presented unique opportunities for retail investors who understand the cyclical nature of markets and can seize the moment when valuations drop dramatically. This is one of the lessons I learned from the LTCM and 2008 financial events.

I have been thinking of writing this for a long time to share my experience in breaking the million dollar investment threshold. For many this could be a small amount but for retail investors like us this is a milestone that could be defining.  My learning from turmoil of the LTCM collapse in 1998 and 2008 financial crisis gave me a good understanding of market dynamics. I got the opportunity to slam dunk my learning during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Most vulnerable time in the financial market also offers maximum opportunity. These crises, while devastating for many, have also presented unique opportunities for savvy retail investors who understand the cyclical nature of markets and can seize the moment when valuations drop dramatically.

**The LTCM Collapse (1998)**

The near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 sent shockwaves through the financial world. LTCM was a hedge fund with highly-leveraged positions based on sophisticated mathematical models that bet on small inefficiencies in bond markets. When Russia defaulted on its debt, LTCM's strategies unraveled, nearly collapsing global markets. This crisis showed that even models created by Nobel laureates cannot account for all risks, particularly when they involve leverage on a massive scale.

In hindsight, for retail investors, the lesson was clear: over-leveraging and overconfidence in complex strategies without fully accounting for unforeseen global events can be disastrous. However, those who understood that the panic and forced selling by institutions created opportunities for buying distressed assets could profit once stability returned.

**How long before stability returns?**

**How do we identify drivers that will bring stability back?**

**The 2008 Financial Crisis**

The 2008 financial crisis was even more widespread, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value, leading to the collapse of major financial institutions, and triggering the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The crisis, triggered by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, exposed systemic flaws in the financial system, particularly in risk management, regulation, and banking practices. Stock markets plummeted, with the S&P 500 losing more than 50% of its value from its peak in late 2007 to the market low in March 2009.

What I observed was that while many investors panicked and liquidated their portfolios at the bottom of the market, those with a long-term perspective saw this as an incredible opportunity. Warren Buffett’s famous quote, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” encapsulates the mindset of those who were able to invest during this period of intense fear. Stocks of solid companies were being sold off at bargain prices, and those who bought during the downturn saw exceptional returns in the subsequent years as the market rebounded.

For example, those who invested in large-cap U.S. stocks or even broader indices like the S&P 500 when the market bottomed in 2009 more than doubled their investments in the next five years. The crisis reaffirmed the principle that ***market downturns, while painful, often provide the best opportunities for long-term investors to buy valuable assets at a discount.***

The learning from 2008 was engraved in my mind. While I knew the opportunity for exponential growth was there but could do little with limited access to funds and probably needed more convictions on my own beliefs.

I was indeed building up my confidence to ride the next disruption and financial turmoil!!

**The COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**

·         **What did I observe?**

·         **What did I do?**

·         **Lessons learned from past**

·         **What was the end result?**

The COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves through global economies in early 2020, causing markets to plummet. By March 2020, global stock indices had fallen significantly, as investors feared that the pandemic would lead to a long-lasting recession. Lockdowns, business closures, and travel bans wreaked havoc on many industries, with sectors like airlines, hospitality, and retail being hit hardest.

·         Share prices Nasdaq Index funds plummeted.

·         Mortgage interest rates went down.

·         Banks were offering mortgage payment holidays.

·         Federal governments were offered financial support to deserving citizens in an unprecedented way.

Was this the right time to put to use my learning from the past? Was this the once in a lifetime opportunity that I was waiting for?

It felt like all the galactic forces were pulling everything together to offer an unprecedented opportunity.

Unlike previous crises, I predicted that the recovery from the COVID-19 crash would be swift, fueled by unprecedented levels of government stimulus, monetary easing from central banks, and rapid advancements in vaccine development. By the second half of 2020, markets had already started to rebound sharply, with many indices hitting new all-time highs.

For retailer investors like me with the foresight and conviction to invest during the darkest days of March and April 2020, the COVID-19 market crash presented an extraordinary buying opportunity—a ""slam dunk"" moment.  Many high-quality companies with strong fundamentals saw their stock prices fall dramatically as fear dominated the market. I was never so ready to willingly take the risk and invest in sectors poised to benefit from the pandemic or the subsequent recovery. Access to market data eliminated the disadvantage of 1998 and 2008 crisis.

Reditt community gives you extraordinary research materials from fellow reditter.  Internet and forums in Reditt, Facebook, X, Instagram and youtube channels mass mobilized retail investors. The power of the internet in connecting retail investors imploded. Trends and market dynamics was easy to identify.

This was indeed the once in a lifetime opportunity to ""Slam Dunk"". Every hypothesis I had on a recovery model was exhibited during the COVID pandemic led by government and financial institution intervention.

Companies that facilitated remote work, e-commerce, and digital entertainment flourished as lockdowns shifted consumer behavior. Technology giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Zoom saw unprecedented growth. I pivoted to tech stocks early in the pandemic and realized extraordinary gains, as these companies became essential services in a world adapting to remote work and digital interaction.

As the world focused on combating COVID-19, the healthcare and biotechnology sectors saw a surge in demand. While I continued to surf the Health Care websites to get appointments for COVID vaccine, I also did tremendous amount of research into companies involved in vaccine development, diagnostics, and treatments for the virus that experienced massive inflows of capital. I recognized this early seized opportunities in companies like Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical and biotech firms.

After the initial market shock, sectors that were initially hard-hit, like airlines, hotels, and entertainment, became attractive. I believed that a recovery was inevitable once vaccines were developed and economies reopened.  This was indeed an opportunity to buy into beaten-down stocks in these sectors during the downturn. Recovery was already evident in late 2020 and into 2021.

Unlike the delayed and fragmented response during the 2008 financial crisis, governments and central banks around the world acted quickly in 2020, providing massive amounts of fiscal stimulus and lowering interest rates to near zero. This injection of liquidity helped support asset prices, leading to a faster recovery than many expected. Investors who understood the impact of these measures were able to position themselves for strong returns in both equities and bonds.

The key takeaway is that during times of market stress, when fear is widespread, there are opportunities to invest in quality assets at depressed prices. Investors who can maintain discipline, focus on long-term value, and have the courage to buy when others are selling are often rewarded handsomely when the market recovers.

**Lessons Learned**

**Seize Opportunities:** During market downturns, buy quality assets at depressed prices.

**Maintain Discipline:** Focus on long-term value and have the courage to buy when others are selling.

**Leverage Technology:** Access to market data and online communities like Reddit helped eliminate past disadvantages.

**Real estate:** Offers a great opportunity to increase your real estate portfolio.

During times of market stress, those who stay disciplined and invest in quality assets often see significant rewards when the market recovers. While it was risky, I have no regrets and believe my experiences could inspire others to navigate future financial turmoil successfully.

**End result:**

From a very modest investment of $200K in stocks and mutual funds, my portfolio crossed the million-dollar threshold. My real estate portfolio expanded from one rental unit to five with modest positive cash flow.

These experiences reinforced the idea that crises, while challenging, also provide moments of extraordinary opportunity for those who are prepared.

1gk0h98,Good investment besides stocks?,29,"Hello all,

I'm looking to invest in something that makes money slowly and steadily. 

S&P 500 is an obvious choice, but would love to see if there is anything else that I should be looking into. 

One idea is turkey properties (ie. out of state rentals managed through a property mgmt company). My concern here is that I feel like real estate is at its peak, and the companies that offer that type of thing add premiums so I'd be paying a fair amount over market to buy each property. With prices at an all time high and interest rates high too, it feels like the wrong time to do that. 

I would consider buying a rental locally, but I'm in CA and the law here is extremely biased against the landlords (plus prices are out of control).

I’ve come up with an idea for possible outsized returns and looking for feedback.  

Right now we are in a 2-year bull market.  On average there is a recession about every 5 years.  So I plan on investing more in less volatile ETFs with high dividends such as SCHD or possibly a covered call ETF.  I will also allocate some to VOO for full market growth and extra diversity.  I am thinking something like 60% SCHD and 40% VOO for now.  in the event of a recession I expect SCHD to perform better than a growth ETF, be that tomorrow or 5 years from now.   

Now in the event of a recession, I will adjust my allocations.  I will take advantage of the higher volatility of growth ETFs and focus on increasing these positions while they are discounted.  Allocating 60% SCHG and 40% VOO.  I am wondering if this is a decent strategy or if I am fooling myself.  I’m not sure how to backtest and some of these funds aren’t very old anyways.

I see on 6/30/2024, that Siblis Research has the world CAPE ratio at: 24.00

\[from here: https://siblisresearch.com/data/world-cape-ratio/\]

I see on the same date (well off by one day), the US CAPE ratio is: 35.45

\[from here: https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/table/by-year\]

Looking at the prospectus for Vanguard VT ETF (total world ETF  by market cap weight) I see that (due to the US bubble), market cap weighted value of the US in world equity markets right now in VT ETF is 62.3% (it hasn't changed much over the past year either).

\[from here: https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt#portfolio-composition\]

So doing some math I determine that given the above, I calculate that CAPE of the rest of the world equity weighted index EX-US must be around 5.35

i.e.  
(US CAPE: 35.45 \* 0.623) + (EXUS CAPE:  5.35\*.377) = 24.00 World CAPE (the result as Siblis published)

This seems so extreme (rest of the world is so cheap!), to the degree that I cannot believe my math is right, but I cannot figure out what is wrong.

Thoughts anyone, has the rest of the world really gotten so cheap due to the US bubble, or is there something else wrong with my math?

The only thing I can think of is that Siblis maybe is not market weighting their Cape ratio when calculating, but if that was the case their result would be so nonsensical to be useless, so I cannot imagine its that, so am looking for other reasons.

1gjtcju,"""Scoop & Save"" - An Election Strategy",5,"A lot of people have been trying to figure out what to buy in anticipation of election day tomorrow. Knowing that it's likely to be an election WEEK or longer - I think it might be better to keep cash on the sidelines (some have followed Buffett's lead on this) to wait for large dips across the board, to scoop up savings.

Cash deployment in the next month is critical.

Some sectors that have been blinking, possibly to be impacted by the next week regardless of who wins: banking, entertainment/media, and the mining/uranium industry.

BANKING

Many of these institutions are at either their COVID peak, their housing peak, or dot-com peak.

The only conversation in finance that has exponential growth is crypto, which both candidates have supported - Trump more so given his family has their own currency - and it's looking more like a crisis coming in Q2 2025, so a few banks will probably start showing weakness through the Fed meetings after the election.

ENTERTAINMENT/MEDIA

While many people recognize that DJT is a proxy for his election chances, and many are playing options expiring this week or through inauguration day, the volatility here might be too unpredictable to rely on.

But, DJT is suing Paramount (CBS News) on the surface because of the way they handled Harris' interview. SONY is suing CBS over undercutting them on Wheel of Fortune & Jeopardy. Comcast is considering selling off their news division. A consolidation & competition effort is emerging in this industry across all the AMPTP companies especially since many of them are tied up in AI.

MINING/URANIUM

Nuclear threats & big tech's use of uranium seems to be only on the rise.

Some winners & losers may be getting picked soon.

SUMMARY

These industries are poised to have big swings after the election and before inauguration, and few people are looking here yet. With more attention elsewhere on election betting or DJT options, these industries could see big dollars made for you fellow regards if you act fast, as things react in real time - rather than trying to outsmart everybody ahead of time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gjtcju/scoop_save_an_election_strategy/,wallstreetbets,"CBS, COVID, MEDIA, WEEK, I, SONY, AMPTP, AI, DJT, A"

Just discovered this concept, and I'm curious! 🤔",0,"I just came across something called a ""**Prize-Linked Savings Account**"" (PLSA), and it’s an interesting concept. Basically, instead of earning interest on your savings, each deposit gives you a chance to win prizes. From what I’ve read, these accounts seem ''popular'' in places like the UK (Premium Bonds) and the US (like ""Save to Win""). Not sure about the names.

The idea is that you keep your original deposit safe, so there’s no risk of losing what you put in. But instead of interest, you have a shot at winning cash or other prizes through regular drawings.

Has anyone heard of someone actually using one of these? Curious to hear any thoughts!

Palantir Technologies Inc. announced on Monday its revenue in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024 saw an annual increase of 30% to reach $726 million, beating estimates. The company's net income grew by 20% compared to the same period in 2023 to hit $143.5 million. Meanwhile, its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 100% to land at $0.06.



The data analytics company has benefited from a boom in GenAI technology, as more companies turn to its AI platform, which is used to test, debug code and evaluate AI-related scenarios.



The company now expects 2024 revenue in a range of $2.805 billion to $2.809 billion, up from its prior expectation of $2.742 billion to $2.750 billion.

The company is among the largest beneficiaries of a rally in AI-linked stocks, with its shares up more than 140% so far this year. It was added to the S&P 500 in September and has outperformed the index's 20% year-to-date gain.

Has a 15% short float. 

Trading at the price not seen since 2003.

So beaten and bruised, it might be a speculative play that yields big. How do you get internet wifi on a plane in the middle of the atlantic ocean, or pacific or at airport runway or over des moines, iowa? That's viasat. They operate on american, delta, united, emirates, jpn, and about 30 other major airlines. How do military get satellite internet in the middle of syria or some shithole somewhere? They don’t just tap abu’s wifi, they use viasat.

This is a geostationary(GEO) satellite company that services commercial airlines, and government contracts. Bad news: Starlink is the direct competition. Viasat acquired Inmarsat(European satellite fleet) in 2023 which cost billions. While Viasat’s revenues grew post-acquisition, increased costs and technical setbacks mean it currently lags in profitability compared to starlink. The viasat 3 constellation is 3 satellites the covers the Americas, Europe, and Asia, for full global coverage of satellite internet. The europe and asia satellites are set to launch in 2025 based on last earnings call. Inmarsat recently successfully launched 2 satellites over the arctic for government/military customers.

Despite current losses, the Inmarsat acquisition provides considerable upside. Viasat is now positioned as one of the most comprehensive global providers of high-speed satellite connectivity, competing against starlink, However, Viasat has a unique advantage: its satellite network spans multiple orbits, including geostationary and low-Earth orbit satellites, which cater to both commercial and government needs. 

Earnings wednesday after market close. Im expecting good updates related to viasat 3 and inmarsats satellites and positive earnings. Tied in with high short float and complete stock decline the whole year yields to me a good degenerate earnings gamble for playing the opposite of what you should do(puts).

1gjo53y,Would passive losses from real estate work against REIT income? ,0,"I tried asking this in the real estate investing sub, got deleted (really wish there would be explanation for deleted questions).

Suppose you have a rental property and you put it in an LLC. You also consistently operate at a loss, on paper, due to the various tax advantages afforded to owning real estate. At the same time, the LLC buys shares of a reliable REIT (which REIT doesn't matter, this is a thought exercise). Income from REITs get taxed at the owner's highest tax rate. However, since the shares are owned by an LLC that is not actually making any taxable income, would that mean that the income the LLC is getting from the REIT would be protected from taxes?

September 17ish - I requested a roll over of funds to be wired into a Fidelity account. The wire was returned bc Fidelity needed updated beneficiaries info - okay, whatever. However JH never told me it was returned. I checked on my account, saw the funds weren’t there and had to investigate the reason, JH could still not give me answers but Fidelity did. 

September 25 - I updated my info and let JH know to send the wire, they say okay - apparently wire to the wrong location, returned again but this time Fidelity updates me. 

September 26 - I update JH of the returned wire and ask to send it correctly but now they tell me this needed to be completed within 10 days of notification or the money would be sent by check & they already sent the check (reminder there was NO notification).

October 7 - Check is received and returned to JH as they didnt put any account info on the check, just FBO name. My name is super common, it would be like saying John Smith.  Nobody alerts me that check is returned. 
  
Oct 14 - Im still waiting for this check to show. Call JH and told everything is fine, fidelity needs to handle. Call Fidelity - no record of check on my account. Oct 16 - JH says all good/Fidelity has no record of check. Oct 17 - Fidelity does system search for amount & finds check, advises they returned it 10days earlier.

Oct 17 - JH knows nothing about check or return, says it must be because USPS but i should stop the check and start the whole process over. So I do, only this time I just have it sent to me so I can work directly with Fidelity. All paperwork is submitted

Oct 21 - JH confirms all paperwork received, everything is fine just waiting for 2-3 days for stop check and 2-3 dates for direct deposit. This week I still call every day M-F for reassurance. Every day everything is fine.

October 29 - still no DD. Call JH and told it paperwork is incomplete bc its missing pgs 7-10 (these pages are all directions). End up getting hung up on by customer service. Call back & told its missing page 2 (a completely blank page about tx funds to a new bank). End up getting hung up on again when questioning validity. At this point i stop calling customer service and call the direct office which was used by ex Employer and talked to specific account manager. He confirms they have lost page 2, but i cant just send it i have to start completely over AGAIN. Fine. Get all paperwork completed and provided and give directly to him. 

Oct 30 - verify everything is in order. Verify that i should have $ in 2-3 business days as that is what paper says. He doesnt get back to me until EOB and advises no it will be DD within 10-14 days for JH to do regular review but he did ‘prioritize’ it so should be soon.

1gjgfct,Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,811,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was off 0.6% and Broadcom rose 1.7%.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gjgfct/nvidia_overtakes_apple_to_become_worlds_largest/,stocks,UBS

1gjfea0,The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,66,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  
◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  
◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional ""data silos""  
◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  
  
**Investment Framework**  
**Key Questions:**  
◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  
◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  
◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   
◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  
  
**Risk Indicators:**  
◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  
◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  
◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  
◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  
  
**Portfolio Implications**  
**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  
◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  
◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  
◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  
  
**Emerging Players:**  
◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  
◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  
◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  
  
**The Long View**  
◾ The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  
◾ ""Data wars"" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  
◾ AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  
  
**Questions for Investors**  
◾ How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  
◾ What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  
◾ How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?

I hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI. I'm eager to hear others' thoughts on these potential market dynamics and data challenges in the journey towards general artificial intelligence.

1gjexjg,New York Times adds fewer digital subscribers as spending tightens,157,"New York Times posted fewer-than-expected digital subscribers for the third quarter as readers cut back on spending in an uncertain economy, offsetting strong growth in advertising sales.

The company added 260,000 digital-only subscribers, compared with 300,000 additions in the previous quarter. Analysts expected the company to add 280,200 subscribers, according to Visible Alpha.

Heightened political advertising in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election helped the company’s ad revenue of $118.4 million beat analysts’ estimates of $116.93 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It reported total revenue of $640.2 million, compared with estimates of $640.8 million.

New York Times forecast subscription revenues to grow by 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, slightly below expectations for 8.2% growth.

Revenue from sports news site The Athletic, purchased by the New York Times in 2022, jumped 29.8% to $44.7 million from $34.4 million a year ago.

1gjd018,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace",0,"**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.

**Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**

Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.

Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position. 

**Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**

Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth. 

The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.

**Valuation and Investment Prospects**

Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.

**Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**

Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.

Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.

**Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.

One of the most underrated yet important aspects of leading a company is them vision. 

Good for us there’s one man who has just dat and his name is Peter J Beck. 

He wants his company to become a multi generational one and has paved the way for it to happen. 

The following are the way and the next catalysts : 

- Winning a big contract, long overdue it’s been 6+ months without anything relevant 
- Seing a “hop” of Neutron booster meaning the booster going up and back down without exploding 
- Seing full Neutron vertical on them pad 
- Announcement of what the mega constellation will be 

This last point alone is a potential multi bagger. The space economy is a violent one and destroys cash and balance sheets at a rapid gaylocity. 

The only way to be FCF positive on the long run is not to launch, it’s to have a paying service ! A mega constellation selling subscriptions for the greatest number. 

A lot of companies can build a mega constellation, not many can build one AND send it to its target orbit : 

- Only SpaceX has achieved this prowess. 

- Blue Origin seems to be on its way ever since daddy Bezos left Amazon to 100% focus. 

- $RKLB is the next one to do just dat.

1gj8jsk,Union Pacific Railroad (UNP),7,"Take a look at the last 4-5 years from August - January. It seems there may be a pattern of hitting close to, or setting a 52-week low shortly after or before the 3rd quarter report only to jump back to their 52-week high or close, anyway.

ForecastEx pays them interest on the cash collateral of the event contracts (after all, the election contracts don’t resolve until January 7 but users have already purchased those contracts so that cash is being invested), but Robinhood doesn’t share that interest with its users. Other platforms like Kalshi (4.05%), IBKR (4.33%), etc. do share interest from events contracts with buyers.

Being able to bet on the election is “cool” but it’s a really poor investment because you’re trying up cash and letting Robinhood earn interest on it.

CEO made 2 announcements in September within 2 days with polar opposite answers, first they were going to move away from (1.6 billion dollar project 25% of market cap) (DRI and EMF for clean environment). Because he didn’t want to front the money for something that would cost more to produce the same product. And then 2 days later the cost will actually be reduced and save them 450 million a year. It’s completely insane to have 2 statements that’s are this contradictory, without of knowing he said something wrong which I’m sure there was instantly a shareholder meeting with executives to revoke this statement right away and to continue to push Biden agenda for clean deal Biden passed for $6 Billion dollar grants for steelmakers. Although Lorenco saying “I don’t think it’s worth it to pony up other $1.1 billion” this is after 500 million $ grant. Both articles linked below with his statements. These articles were within 2 days of one another and cause mass panic at the plant. This was also followed by huge wide layoffs to Cliffs administrators and Subcontractors. The layoffs are still happening. This is not an isolated to my plant but to all Cliffs plants. We’re stacking steel and no one is buying.  I see for the foreseeable future see layoffs continuing until economy starts turning around.Also the head department bosses don’t care about contractor safety and completely neglect safety standards and OSHA Laws to push production and fail to oblige to practical maintenance standards.

This means that if the company CH11's and is liquidated \*right now\* (for the sake of simplicity, i am ignoring liquidity discounts/market discovery/market price fluctuations of assets etc.) shareholders will get 23.10 USD \*after\* settling all debts and liabilities. The stock price is currently $23.20 so its basically trading \*at\* book value. Worst case you lose 10 cents + time value of money on $23.10 while waiting for liquidation/bailout. So where are the ""share price can go to zero"" concerns coming from? Is it simply the concern that they will erode their book value to zero?

Edit: The GM example is not valid. Quick googling (please feel free to double check) shows the GM CH11 filing reported US$82.29 billion in assets and US$172.81 billion in debt.

1gj2kur,The Wild Ride of a Decade in Trading: To Continue or Not?,181,"Hey fellow Redditors! 🌟

Buckle up because I’ve been on the trading rollercoaster for the past 10 years, and boy, what a ride it’s been! 🎢

About three years ago, I decided to throw my hat (and some cash) into the options ring with OCGN. Spoiler alert: I hit the jackpot and made $100K! 💰🎉 But just when I thought I was on top of the world, I decided to test my luck again with a put option for SPY. Let’s just say the universe had other plans for me, and I lost a whopping $80K. 😱

Fast forward a bit, and now I'm in a love-hate relationship with taxes. Apparently, Uncle Sam wanted his slice of the pie too, and I had to take out a loan to pay taxes because of a wash sale. Who knew trading could come with a side of financial acrobatics? 🤹‍♂️

Now, for the last three years, I’ve gone all in on one biotech company. It's like my version of a romantic commitment—complete with hopes, dreams, and a bit of anxiety. So here I am, wondering: should I keep trading and risk my sanity (or what’s left of it) or throw in the towel and embrace the peaceful life of a non-trader? 

What do you all think? Keep the trading adventure alive or retire my trading hat for good? Your insights are much appreciated!

1gj1xq7,Which stocks to buy if you think China will attack Taiwan in the next few years,0,"
While many people do not take China's ambitions to annex Taiwan seriously or even ridicule them, military experts are certain that China will force a military reunification from 2027 to 2030 at the latest if no peaceful settlement has taken place by then. There are various reasons for this, which have also been set out in a DOD document.

President Xi Jinping's ""cult of personality"" and his historical goal

Xi has pursued the goal of ""reunifying"" China, including Taiwan, since coming to power in 2012. In order to secure his historical role and political legacy, he may want to annex Taiwan by force during his lifetime if peaceful measures fail. Xi's third term and the possibility of lifelong leadership reinforce this incentive. The ""completion"" of the Chinese nation would be a symbolic legacy, similar to the successes of Mao Zedong.

Modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 2027

The PLA has set significant modernization goals by 2027 to prepare it for military engagement around Taiwan. By building advanced armed forces and increasing its military presence in the Taiwan region, China could aim for ""rapid annexation"" to minimize international intervention and isolate Taiwan.

Demographic pressure and window of opportunity 

China's population is aging rapidly, which could create long-term economic and military challenges. Between 2027 and the early 2030s, before these demographic problems become more acute, Xi sees a ""window of opportunity"" for invasion. This would allow him to achieve his political goal before domestic political and economic problems complicate such an operation.

And now coming to the shares...

The stocks should have as little exposure to China or Taiwan as possible. Neither in terms of supply chains, nor in terms of China or Taiwan as a sales market for the company in question. Furthermore, the company should benefit from the attack, e.g. because it is active in the western defence sector and will receive more government funding after the attack, or because it will substitute Chinese products after trade relations with China have been severed. At best, the share should not yet be valued too expensively. 

It is very difficult to find suitable companies. Most defence stocks are already very expensively valued due to the war in Ukraine and Israel, and the probable easing of tensions until at least 2027 will result in financial losses. Boeing is still relatively favourably valued, although the military sector only accounts for 30% of total sales and 20% of civil aviation orders come from China. 

Automobile manufacturers that are hardly represented on the Chinese market, such as Stellantis, could also be of interest. However, this would of course cause major supply chain difficulties.

For many, Intel would probably be the best guess. Intel currently still generates 30% of its sales in China, but the Chinese government wants to remove foreign chips from strategically relevant components by 2027 anyway, so the resulting loss of sales may already be priced in. The question remains to what extent Intel would suffer from supply chain issues in the event of a trade disruption with China.

I wanted to give a suggestion with my post and open up the possibility for discussion. Which stocks do you think are most likely to benefit from this likely massive geopolitical event? U.S.-American mining companies? Semiconductor producers?

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

1giwap6,what is the best way to offset my rent,2,"My spouse and I rent a place for $26000 a year. Due to work, we move every 2–3 years, so buying a home doesn’t seem viable because of the upfront costs in combination with the short time we will be spending there. However, I do have a decent amount in savings and want to make the most of it. My goal is to offset our rent so we can maintain the flexibility to relocate, but also see good returns on our money.

Here are a few options I’m considering:

1. Buy a $300K Home in Our Current City
A mortgage for $150K (after a $150K down payment) would result in interest payments that are about half of our current rent. Plus, there’s potential for property appreciation. if we move again i could:
* sell, the closing costs would probably evenout the appriciation.
* find tenants, but i will have the same problem again in the place we will be moving to

2. Purchase a Home in my home country to rent out
This would allow me to have a long-term tenant. We probably need to find a smaller place that requires less of a mortgage. which is a bit more challeging for that budget.

3. Invest in an Index Fund, e.g., S&P 500
With an optimistic return of 10% annually, this could cover over half of our rent. However, this option misses out on potential real estate appreciation.

VWRP fees are 0.22% and the VHVG+VFEG pie would total 0.13%, so I think I would definitely save on fees in the long term. 

I watched a video by Chris Palmer claiming the latter is the best Vanguard investment option and it seemed pretty convincing. 

However I’m just wondering if it’s too good to be true? Are there any potential risks? His video didn’t cover it so I wanted to know if there are any drawbacks of using this pie instead of a single world ETF? Is the emerging market ETF reliable? Would the pie be hard to rebalance?

1gis61k,Healthcare company with a MOAT ?,42,"Hey all,

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

I was thinking about changing to 70% SS S&P 500 index II, 20% Brokerage Link for S&P 500 options like SWTSX or maybe SWISX, and 10% international. I wasn’t sure which investment fund to choose or if this is a good idea in general. All help would be greatly appreciated.

(I think), I understand futures & options quite well, but don't fully understand leveraged ETPs (exchange traded products), which claim to perform 3X / 5X / 10X of an index or any other underlying e.g. Apple.

So, let's say I buy such a product, 10X on Apple. If Apple crashes 12%, do I lose **more than** my capital? Here, I'm talking about 12% loss in a day, and not 6+6% over two days, which could lower my investments to near-zero but not zero or negative.

1giofp5,Physical gold ETFs and counterparty risk from authorized participants,33,"I read this about counterparty risk with authorized participants. Would this bother you, and could it be avoided by buying a gold mutual fund instead? The second article talked about the risk in London. I don't know how this might apply to gold held in other countries. I am based in Japan and have the option of buying an ETF that holds all the gold inside Japan. Are the risks below universal for all physical gold ETFs regardless of the country?

""He added: “Unlike physical gold, ETFs have counterparty risk, because there’s a possibility that the other parties, such as the Authorized Participant (AP), the trustee or others, may default or fail to uphold their part of the agreement.”

Barisheff argued that, with the recent increased popularity of ETFs, many investors assume they are like open-end mutual funds, but with much lower management fees, and that “Wall Street has become generous”. Investors need to understand the difference, he said, to realise the benefits of an open-end mutual fund trust, such as the BMG mutual funds.""

""This matters because investors naturally expect custodians to be properly regulated. It also matters because the bullion market settles through a separate entity called London Precious Metals Clearing Limited (lpmcl.com) owned by five LBMA members, including the two custodians for GLD and SLV. LPMCL is therefore at the heart of the London bullion market.

Because the bullion market in London is over-the-counter, bullion banks are exposed to counterparty risk, unlike traders on a regulated market. And if a big bullion bank fails, which is certainly possible in a global banking crisis, all the bullion held by the members of the LPMCL both for themselves and their clients could become available to central banks managing the crisis through the Bank of England.

In a systemic meltdown it may be naïve to expect central banks to fully respect property rights. So GLD and SLV are only suitable for investors prepared to accept a lower standard of custodial regulation, and who look to benefit from a rising gold or silver price until they decide to take their profits. They are definitely not for those seeking a safe haven or hedge from a financial crisis.""

1ginwra,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,0,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

1gijauq,Buybacks or IPOs? Which is better as a retail investor?,0,"My take:

**Advantages of Buybacks**

**1. Boosting Share Value**: Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price.

Eg: Apple has a series of buybacks for billions of dollars that has benefitted a lot of shareholders.

**2. Boosting Investor Confidence**: Buybacks can boost investor sentiment. Investors interpret it as a sign that the company expects to perform well in the future.  

**Advantages of IPOs**

**1. Growth Potential:** IPOs provide an opportunity to invest in a company at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards as the company grows.

**2. Market Sentiment:** IPOs often attract considerable market attention and investor interest, which can lead to initial price surges.

Example: Paras Defence was listed at a premium of 171% leading to instant gains for buyers in a short time. It does not end here. The share price surged by another 143% within 3 weeks giving more gains to the shareholders.

While buybacks are good for existing shareholders as they can sell their shares above the market price, IPOs provide decent prices for retail investors to accumulate shares in case they are able to get allocation for the applied IPO.

1gifnh6,MSTR a Ponzi Scheme,355,"MSTR is probably the biggest overvalued stock in the US at the moment and I would expect the stock to drop by 50% in the coming month. Here is why:


- MSTR is trading at almost 250% premium of its bitcoin holding value meaning that when you buy MSTR, it’s equivalent to buy Bitcoin at 3.5x its value or $245k per XBT.
- MSTR has a 17.8% Bitcoin yield as its issuing new shares at 250% premium to buy Bitcoin at discount, while Bitcoin yield is much lower. This strategy would be attractive only if it was sustainable in the long run but as soon as MSTR drops, this yield will decrease or even go negative if MSTR trades at discount.
- MSTR announced this week that it will raise $42b to buy Bitcoin in the next 3 months, $21b via equity issuance and $21b via debt. The retail won’t be able to absorb such amount which will push MSTR significantly lower, as we have seen in similar case like AMC and other. Retail will be ruined once again. The additional debt will also levered MSTR massively which will become an issue when the stock/bitcoin drops as it might force MSTR to do emergency equity raise at discount, putting even more pressure on MSTR. https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-announces-42-billion-capital-plan_10-30-2024
- Chairman Michael Saylor knows that MSTR is overvalued, that’s why he is increasing the pace of its capital increase with 5 equity raises in the last 3 years with much more to come, I don’t think any other company has done that many.
- MSTR had accounting issues back in 2000 sending the short 90%+ lower
- All the brokers with a BUY rating on the stock have magically been picked by MSTR to do the $21b equity issuance. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/G8cJq1F32w

==> By misleading the retail community with its Bitcoin yield, retail prefers to buy MSTR rather than Bitcoin, pushing MSTR at a huge premium and allowing  MSTR to sell even more shares to the retail community, allowing to buy more Bitcoin, increasing its Bitcoin yield. This is exactly the definition of a Ponzi Scheme: 

“A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gifnh6/mstr_a_ponzi_scheme/,wallstreetbets,"US, MSTR, XBT, I, AMC, BUY, A"

1gi7s8w,SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,23,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gi7s8w/snowflakes_stock_buyback_and_shortterm_optimism/,stocks,A

1gi70gs,Why i think the market is going to crash after the election no matter who wins.,4313,"I have this theory that because the election is so fucked up, everyone is just holding out to see what shakes out, thinking that someone else will ( depending on who wins) make good investments that they can then base their own math on, IE they expect someone to make the first move.

However, i think no one actually has anything good to invest it, and it will reveal itself immediately the winner is called. Thus i think there will be a whole market crash a couple hours after election night.

Can someone who is good with logic check this thinking through before i yolo my savings?

1gi68k0,My demented mother's financial advisor gave away all her money- What can I do?,267,"Hi-

Is there anything I can do? 

The asshole financial manager in California my mother trusted with her investment and insurance accounts cleaned out all her investment money and gave it to her husband (not my father)-- also a client of his, but NOT a beneficiary and not named anywhere on the account for any reason.  My mother had advanced dementia at the time, which the financial manager was well aware of because he managed her long-term care insurance and filed the caretaker paperwork.  I was my now-deceased mother's POA, the financial advisor never contacted me for any reason, but he accepted a CA state form from the husband in which the husband named himself POA. That form was notarized the very same day my mother's doctor noted ""advanced dementia"" during an office visit. 

I filed a complaint with the SEC, they did jack shit nothing.  Neither did the CA state office that manages the notary program. The financial advisor is still in business and has had at least one previous SEC fine for doing something similar to what he did with my mother's money. 

Is there anything I can do? My mother trusted her financial advisor to protect her $ from her husband's greedy daughter and they all betrayed her the minute she became incapacitated. 

And if you're still reading this- my mother owned her house long before she met her husband, it was paid for. Two years after her first diagnosis of cognitive decline, the husband took a $200,000 loan out against the house and gave it to his daughter. I can't sue the husband because I had to settle with him over the house. 

Is what the financial advisor did legal?  Is there anyone else I should report this to?

1gi41yd,Bill Gates Terrapower with ASP Isotopes,228,"$ASPI These news took ASP Isotopes above 500 million market cap. I want your opinion and what you say about it all. Will Centrus Energy be able to stay relevant coming years when new technologies enter the scene? 

Term sheet say Terrapower will likely pay for the construction of a HALEU enrichment plant. HALEU is the fuel every small modular reactor needs to operate.

I'm guessing huge gains from nano nuclear, oklo, Nuscale etc gonna come ASPIs way. Small Modular Reactors are like cars and cars don't run without gasoline, SMRs don't run without #HALEU. Who's making the biggest bags of money? The people driving the cars or those who sell the gasoline?

They also got contracts for their enriched silicon-28 product which is researched to be the next material in semiconductors. Allowing for cooler and therefore faster chips enabling super intelligent AI and quantum computing.

Two undisclosed contracts with US leading semiconductor companies and in discussions with several others. Any clue on who it could be? I mean Bill Gates grabbing their HALEU, maybe Gates want some si28 as well for Microsoft?

With the current nuclear theme, this is set up deliciously. From $2.90 to $8 in a month and bears are still stubbornly resisting the bull horde.

Icing on the cake, the planned spinoff gives ASPI shareholders incentive to HODL & gobble. Spinoff is 1 for 1. Get an equal amount of QLE shares as you got ASPI for those who HODL on record date yet to be determined.

Terrapower press release: [https://www.terrapower.com/terraPower-announces-strategic-agreement](https://www.terrapower.com/terraPower-announces-strategic-agreement)

45 things to consider with $ASPI. Cheers to u/pennycheck at X for this delicious slice of ASPIe

1. Proprietary Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment technologies for isotope enrichment.
2. Contracts for Carbon-14, Molybdenum-100, and Silicon-28 production, with potential revenues of $12-30 million in 2024.
3. Entering the High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) market, with estimated demand over 600 MT by 2035.
4. Quantum Enrichment method for uranium expected to be more cost-effective and scalable than competitors' technologies.
5. Signed MOUs with two US-based Small Modular Reactor (SMR) companies to supply HALEU.
6. Received interest from potential customers totaling over $30 billion of HALEU demand at recent market prices.
7. Technology allows for HALEU production in a single step, potentially more efficient than competitors.
8. Expects to produce commercial quantities of HALEU by 2027, potentially satisfying all anticipated demand from advanced reactors in development.
9. Market capitalization significantly lower than main competitors despite potentially superior technology.
10. Strong management team with extensive experience in isotope enrichment and finance.
11. 100% employee retention, helping maintain trade secrets and technological advantages.
12. Exploring enrichment of depleted uranium tails, potentially leading to higher margins and lower HALEU prices.
13. Building facilities in Iceland to capitalize on lower electricity costs, potentially improving profitability.
14. Joint venture with PET Labs, allowing entry into the radioisotope market for nuclear medicine.
15. Technology is modular and scalable, allowing for rapid capacity expansion.
16. Significant insider ownership, with management continuing to buy shares.
17. Targeting multiple markets beyond HALEU, including medical isotopes, silicon for quantum computing, and other industrial applications.
18. Favorable market environment due to global push for nuclear energy, including pledge to triple nuclear capacity by 2050 at COP28.
19. Technology could potentially address the HALEU supply bottleneck currently delaying some SMR projects.
20. Potential ability to produce Weapons Grade Uranium (WGU) could lead to additional government contracts.
21. Isotope production extends beyond HALEU, with applications for semiconductors and AI companies.
22. Ytterbium plant commissioned 9 months ahead of schedule, demonstrating efficient execution.
23. Early completion of Ytterbium plant proves Quantum Enrichment technology, applicable to uranium enrichment for HALEU production.
24. Ability to recycle depleted uranium tails makes it attractive for governments wanting to avoid new uranium mining operations.
25. Diverse isotope portfolio makes it relevant to multiple industries and companies.
26. Major tech companies like Amazon and Google investing heavily in nuclear energy projects, likely increasing demand for HALEU fuel.
27. Amazon signed agreements to support development of nuclear energy projects, including new SMRs.
28. Google signed world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple SMRs.
29. Tech giants' involvement could accelerate SMR development and adoption, creating larger market for ASPI's HALEU production.
30. Tech companies cite need for reliable, carbon-free energy to power data centers and AI technologies.
31. US Department of Energy estimates significant job growth in the nuclear industry.
32. International Energy Agency's report supports long-term prospects for nuclear energy.
33. Growing corporate interest in nuclear energy could lead to increased investment in the sector.
34. Successfully enriched Ytterbium-176 using Quantum Enrichment technology.
35. Commissioning phase of Ytterbium-176 facility completed in 6 weeks instead of expected 3-6 months.
36. Expects to achieve 99.75% enrichment for Ytterbium-176 and offer it for commercial sale in 2025.
37. Plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 Quantum Enrichment plants with production targeted for 2025.
38. Potentially the only Western supplier of commercial quantities of Ytterbium-176 and similar isotopes.
39. Quantum Enrichment process believed to be more efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly than other technologies.
40. In discussions with potential customers for HALEU requirements valued at over $37 billion.
41. MOUs with two US-based SMR companies include potential capital investments into HALEU facilities.
42. Accelerating plans for Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 plants due to urgent demand from Western-based producers.
43. Positioning to meet emerging demand for Lithium-6 in nuclear fusion power plants.
44. Recruited Lt. Col. William Eden, MBE to lead nuclear strategy in the United Kingdom.
45. Bill Gates took the first slice of the pie. Bet there's many more wanting a seat at the table.
46. 24% shorted 10 million shares since $2.90-$8

I'm suspecting ASPI and Gates been discussing silicon-28 since it's now clear Terrapower aim to lock up their HALEU production for ten years. All makes sense to me. Lock up the HALEU to fuel SMRs and build datacentres with silicon-28 semiconductors. Aaaand they build SMRs to power their superior datacentres.

Microsoft enters the chip wars: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/welcome-to-the-chip-wars-microsoft/

They will spin off their Uranium business to Quantum Leap Energy. Those who got shares in ASPI will get equal amount of shares in the new company QLE. Plus ASPI will always get 10% of QLEs revenue.

The HALEU plant Bill Gates is paying for and is expected to be non dilutive to shareholders. He will also buy all the HALEU produced there for a ten year period. Gates want to be the global top dog in small modular reactors.

Financially their balance sheet have never been stronger with about $43 million dollar cash.

This is just my opinions and guesses, I'm not a financial advisor. I share information about the company for the community to discuss. So this is not investment advice to sell, buy or do anything speculative. ASPI is worth keeping on the watchlist in my opinion. I keep it in my portfolio, I like the stock so I own the stock.

Meanwhile, a simple HYSA is making over 4%. Now, I know those won't last forever, either, but I can't help but think there is some kind of better fund out there that can make at least a few percent pretty consistently. Even if that means just going HYSA for a while until the rate drops.

1gi2s7x,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,33,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

What are these probabilities on the CME FedWatch? I know that they are based on the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, but they don't make any sense. And maybe none of you reading this post, pay too much attention to these probabilities, but I see too many people speculating on a 0.25% rate cut or even a 0.50% rate cut. I consider a 0.50% rate cut beyond any probability. A 0.25% is a probability, but maybe has a probability of 35%. I think the 3rd option has the highest probability, which is an interest rate cut of 0% (so 65%). If you have followed the economic numbers on a weekly basis, you can see that these numbers are way too positive. 

*U.S. CB Consumer Confidence (forecast 99.5, actual 108.7):* 

Consumers’ assessments of **current business conditions** turned positive in October.

* 21.4% of consumers said business conditions were “good,” up from 18.6% in September.
* 16.4% said business conditions were “bad,” down from 20.5%.

Consumers’ appraisals of the **labor market** improved in October.

* 35.1% of consumers said jobs were “plentiful,” up from 31.3% in September.
* 16.8% of consumers said jobs were “hard to get,” down from 18.6%.



*U.S. JOLTS Job Openings (forecast 7.980M, actual 7.443 M)*

*U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (forecast 110K, actual 233K)*

*U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (forecast 106K, actual 12K)*

*The Initial Jobless Claims (forecast 229K, actual 216K)*

*Unemployment Rate (forecast 4.1%, actual 4.1%)*

The labor numbers can be quite conflicting, but this is normal given that they are collected using different methodologies. The ADP report covers private sector jobs. The NFP report covers public and private sector jobs and is published by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics state agency. Honestly, I don't know the reason behind the huge differences. Haven't checked it in detail but read that it had to do with the strikes and the hurricane from last month. On the other side, have the Initial Jobless Claims been the lowest since May. And not to forget, have the Average Hourly Earnings also increased on a monthly basis. On a yearly basis it remained the same. In other words, there is nothing wrong with the labor market here and it remains very strong. As seen earlier in my post, this is also reflected in U.S. Consumer Confidence. And ultimately it's human behaviour that drives the markets.



*Core PCE Price Index (YoY) (forecast 2.6%, actual 2.7%)*

With the employment numbers we can see that there is a potential for inflation to rise again. With the Core PCE Price Index we can see that it already did after the first cut. 

  
Conclusion: I think that the FED needs to act very careful here, not to let inflation increase again (or maybe go out of control). It cannot be the intention that there will be another interest rate cut of 0,25% now, and that within six months we will have an additional interest rate hike of 0.25% or even 0.50%. Therefore I think that in November we won't see an interest rate cut, and that in December an interest rate cut of 0,25% might be a possibility.

IPPI = (CW/I) + (P/I)

IPPI = Income Factor + Market Value Factor

I am presenting this personal financial tool on Reddit for a couple reasons. First is the time stamping of this new financial tool’s introduction to the public and second is to get the no holds barred critiques from the Reddit environment. This index measures the financial status of a closed investment portfolio (such as an IRA, ROTH, 401K). Personally, my IPPI is about 10.  I am no longer making any investments in my IRA, but my goal is to improve my IPPI number each year with both income and market values.

1ghyq7o,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,1156,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

1ghyedq,$GRPN – Maybe things aren’t as they seem at first glance (?),8,"**High short interest – potential for a short squeeze**  
Currently, 44.03% of Groupon’s float is shorted (9.26 million out of 39.5 million shares), indicating that the market expects a decline and that investor confidence in GRPN is low. But what if there’s a surprise?

**Q3 YoY traffic growth despite ongoing IT issues**  
Despite what appear to be persistent IT issues, Groupon’s traffic in Q3 has grown by approximately 2.9% YoY according to Similarweb (69.4 million in Q3/23 vs. 71.4 million in Q3/24). While this might not seem like a huge success at first glance, in the context of the company’s projected revenue decline of -10% to -5% YoY for Q3—and given that just a few quarters ago, Groupon was essentially headed toward a wall and almost certain death—this growth actually shows a trend reversal. The IT problems likely persist and may continue for some time due to the historically complex system, but the key takeaway is that if traffic is stabilizing or even growing slightly YoY, then management’s most optimistic outlook could be met, or possibly even exceeded.

**New frontend in the U.S. – better conversion rates likely**  
Groupon recently launched a new frontend that was initially tested on a small sample of users in the U.S., yielding positive conversion results. Now, it seems that the new frontend has been rolled out across the entire U.S., so it’s reasonable to anticipate improved conversions, which should translate to higher revenue.

I’m not expecting a massive breakthrough, but rather that management is successfully executing their projections to stabilize the company’s cash flow and reverse the long decline in traffic. With the current share price at $10.33 and an expected EBITDA of $60–80 million, the **EBITDA multiple is just 5.1–6.8**. If their outlook is met on the high end or slightly exceeded, and if they project a 5-10% revenue growth for next year, then the current share price is very attractive. Within a reasonable timeframe of 1–2 years, there could be significant revaluation, with the **EBITDA multiple potentially expanding to 10–15x, coupled with organic EBITDA growth**. In addition, there’s a short-term speculative opportunity: a positive outlook could create pressure on short sellers to close positions, potentially driving the stock up in the short term.

**Conclusion and summary:**  
With high short interest, traffic growth despite the expected decline, and a new, likely better-converting website in the U.S. (specifically in the Local segment, which is the company’s core business), Groupon’s situation may be far more optimistic than the market expects. Positive results could trigger a short squeeze in the short term, pushing the stock significantly higher.

The reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.

This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement.

1ghnclj,SMCI Bull Thesis,2,"I have taken a deep dive to truly understand the bull thesis on this stock. Let’s consider what the positives are at the moment:

1. **The fall from the March high of $1200**. Before the split that would be a drop from \~$1200 to $250 roughly a 80% loss in value. Bull Thesis…well after the split the numbers don’t look as bad. 1200 to 250 seems huge when compared to 120 to 25. So the drop now was only $95 vs $950. Psychologically better for a bull thesis when you look at this way…less room to climb!
2. **SMCI has made a complete u-turn to where it traded this time last year:** $1200 back to $250. Bull Thesis: history may repeat itself and you can do this all over again and not make the mistakes you did last time. 
3. **Low cost of entry.** Bull Thesis: If you wait a little bit to buy you may be able to get it at $10.
4. **Hindenburg Report**: Since the report came out two months ago the stock has sold off dramatically. Bull thesis: These claims have not been proven or even discussed by Charles Lang! His silence can only mean these are not true and not worth his time to discuss with shareholders. It is honorable of him to take our time into consideration and not force us to read a statement or watch a video explanation regarding the report. 
5. **10k has yet to be filed**. Bull Thesis: No one knows what the status is... so as far as we know it is a fantastic report. 
6. **DOJ probe**: Bull Thesis: Everyone knows that the DOJ probes almost every tech stock. There hasn't been much word about this lately, so it probably means the government just forgot about it and it is time to buy calls.
7. **EY resigning:** this one is simple. Bull Thesis: The EY resignation means Charles can save money and hire his cousins or other family member’s accounting firm for half the price.
8. **SEC delisting:** Well this one depends on the accounting firm. Bull Thesis: If Charles indeed does have a family member do the audit then the numbers will be golden, delisting averted and it is time to buy calls. 
9. **SP500:** If SMCI is kicked out of the SP500 then it is just 4 more quarters of growth to get back in and the stock will hit $120 again!

So in closing: Sure there are at least 9 items here that are a black cloud hanging  over SMCI. Sure other stocks don’t have these issues and are rallying to all time highs in the most bullish part of the year. Sure, you could sell and put your money in any of these others stocks and not have all these risks. But I see now if I just opened my mind and changed the way I think about SMCI there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This whole time I should have done what most of the sub was doing…buy at ATH’s and DCA! I wasted almost a whole year not dollar cost averaging and now the stock is 80% below the March highs.

1ghmlfr,NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average,214,"

Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel
 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry.  

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc
in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement.

Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple.

1ghmkkz,ELV Elevance Health DD,32,"First time poster long time regaurd

This was Anthem Bluecross Blueshield. They are now a conglomerate including pharmacy and specialty services through Carelon. 

The Bad:

Recently they lost 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees due to an expiration of expanded eligibility from covid funds. (About 3% of total enrollment) And due to higher utilization of patients this quarter the expense ratio was 2.5% higher than normal. Even though revenue grew $1.5 billion, EPS took a big hit. $8.4 vs $9.7 ~ 20%. Not a good quarter. Share price dropped from 509 to 399 before semi recovering and hovering around 409-430. Down from ATH 560 in August 2024

Debt: $5 billion prior debt, with additional $5 billion just authorized.

Bull Case:

They insure nearly 46 million Americans. Private, Medicare & Advantage, Medicaid combined. 3rd largest Insurer in the US. Operate in 14 states normal operation and 26 states for Medicaid.

Medicare Advantage enrollment just started Oct 15 Ends Dec 7 

Medicare enrollment continues to increase annually until peaking in 2030

These 1.5 million Medicaid patients that were dropped will need to seek insurance through one of ELVs more profitable segments Medicare or Advantage. Or through the private market. So I think we will see record enrollment in those segments and re-enrollment in Medicaid in 2025 if they drop coverage for 3 months, continue to be low income and qualify following year 2025 when they report lower incomes in 2024 to shoot for the threshold to get back on.

Buybacks: They authorized $11 billion for buy backs. $8 billion just announced Oct 17th when the price dipped. About 11% of the float. Market cap $96 billion. It's multi year but they are definitely going to buy in at 2 year lows it's trading at now.

https://www.elevancehealth.com/newsroom/elv-quarterly-earnings-q3-2024

Buyback history: high likelihood of $1 Billion + Q4 2024 as they have done in prior years.

https://ycharts.com/companies/ELV/stock_buyback

They just secured an additional $5 billion though notes expiring in 1-40 years for buybacks and acquisitions. Nov 1st 2024

https://www.publicnow.com/view/DF3C8835154DF071863F50FD678A47FF74F9CC84?1730411238

Wellpoint: prior acquisition named Amerigroup representing 6 states under the Elevance umbrella 

Carebridge: Just purchased for $2.7 billion revenue for carebridge has expanded exponentially. 2024 year's growth rate was 150,000% to almost 900 million in revenue. Projected revenue for 2025 is $2.5 billion. 
This is a massive additional to the company and huge profit potential. Also the Cofounder was Bill Frist former US Senator so this company has beneficial ties to politics.

https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/bill-saporito/carebridge-its-the-greatest-problem-in-health-care-americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-it.html

Carelon: serves 1/3 Americans. Revenue grew 20% to $13.8 billion. Operating gain was $800 million in Q3. This is where Elevance is expanding most. This is where the most margin can be grown. 

P/E ratio: 15, highly profitable monopolistic company with $15 billion cash on hand, which still increased in the 'bad' last quarter by $1.3 billion 

Blue chip stock: this is not a crazy valuation play, everyone needs Healthcare and this company highly profitable already. The majority of the Healthcare sector all dipped when Medicaid changed. Even if the election causes turmoil in the markets investors run to blue chips first. It's float is owned by 49% institution investors.

Positions: 26 shares ~ $11,000 @ 431
34 shares ~ $14,000 @ 413 
( I have scwab and robinhood, I'm a pussy and calls are Hella expensive)
This is YOLO for me. 95% of my holdings in ELV.
All my Palantir profit.

I believe the floor is in at 400 and should turn around quickly. 5 year chart shows dips only last 5-30 days before trend reverses. Prediction of 500+ Q4 2024 earnings. 550+ Q1 2025. The buybacks should increase EPS and the company is strategically acquiring higher margin company's and expanding.

1ghl0zv,Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,70,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.

I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.

I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.

I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.

Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.

Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.

The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.

As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!

I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.

Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.

Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.

For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.

I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?

And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.

I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.

Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.

The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.

* **They have ambitious growth plans.** BOOT plans to add 500 more stores in the next few years, which could generate $1.5 billion in new sales. They expect these stores to be highly profitable with a fast payback period.
* **Their CEO was a big part of their success.** He led the company through a period of massive expansion, increasing the store count from 80 to almost 500.

And depending on how risky you feel it goes up and down. Just like how depending on how risque your mom feels, she goes up and down.

And if we had, like, perfect information, complete visibility, like the visibility through your mom's bedroom window, the price of the swap would always be the same as the fixed. But obviously not all windows are as clear as your mom's bedroom window and so there's a premium you pay to hedge, which is why in theory the fixed rate you're paying for the 10y swap would be higher than the rate of the 10y.

And now, this is where you have to help me because my job as an off-season mall Santa is at risk due to all the crying due to all the losing money. These spreads are so inverted right now, makes me feel like I'm being spread, and that's not a good look on a fat middle-aged mall Santa. Because the market is basically saying that some contract from a random bank is worth more than a bond from the U.S. government. And that can't be right, right?

And yet, there's where we are. More than 50 basis points of negative spread.

What the hell is going on here? Please help me. I already asked my financial advisor and my alcoholics anonymous group and my old drinking buddy Ben Bernanke and nobody knew the answer.

Holiday sales will be better than last year. U.S. sales could jump 8.4% to a record $240 billion. Online shoppers will be more open to offers and more willing to buy nicer, more expensive items after months of choosing cheaper alternatives. Premium goods are expected to increase by 19%.

I expect a good next quarter and the whole year for Adobe. 5-month option Apr17’25 @ 520 give an excellent perspective for collecting good profits. At the option price of $33.50 (at the time of writing) with the increase of the shares to the price of $550 (below the last maximum) we have a potential profit of 110%. If the price increases to $580, the potential profit increases to 180%. At the price of $600 it would give a 200% profit. AVG target analysts are at the level of $620-640.

1ghdzcx,Europe is going tits up or The greatest bull market in history,1790,"**Premise**

It's not news that Europe as a continent has been struggling to keep up with the US. Innovation is lacking, regulation is abundant, cheap ru$$ian gas is gone, Germany is committing suicide, Fr\*nce is full of fr\*nch and Southern Europe is just a retirement home at this point. Ah, and the UK has being doing horribly since Brexit and food shortages are still going on even if they don't make the news.

**The numbers**

Economically speaking, if you take the GDP of the EU, you'll see that it's almost half that of the US, or about two thirds if you believe the PPP figure (you shouldn't, nobody cares how many big macs you can afford in a day, it's useless). The PPP detachment from reality can easily be observed if you take any market you like and compare the sales volume. For example, taking the car market in 2023 you can see that 22 cars were sold in the EU per 1000, while 43 cars were sold per 1000 people in the US. Sure you could say ""muh EU's got trains"", but that's only true for Western Europe which is half the total population.

In addition to this, most EU countries are facing a pension crisis that's going to obliterate the budget for infrastructures in the near future. Either that, or we are going to let pensioners live in absolute poverty to keep up the welfare state.

**The meat**

What's interesting to notice is that the financial literacy of younger Europeans is incredibly higher than the one of their parents and grandparents. On the flip side, young Europeans are incredibly broke, because of the welfare state, the Ponzi-pension schemes, and other shit which is constantly extracting value from the economy and putting it into the already fat accounts of elderly people who are not spending anything, not investing in anything and just parking their money, stopping the economy as a result.

But, all things come to an end, even their lives. And all that money is gonna flow in the pockets of young people with access to the US stock market. These generations are gonna know that the State will never be able to pay a decent pension, so they'll either invest on their own or put all that wealth into private pension funds that, you guessed it, will just invest in the US stock market, 'cause no one would ever invest in shitty EU clones of successful US businesses.

I can see that this ball is starting to roll with the current generation of Europeans entering the job market. We are looking at at least two decades of European money just pouring into the US stock market from everywhere in the EU.

1ghdgvf,MSTR - a one stock bubble - mini due diligence,5,"This is not financial advice. This is simply a compilation of the data and my interpretation of the company and the stock. My opinions are directed towards MSTR specifically, and not BTC, as I do believe in BTC as a store of value and a long term investment. This is a mini due diligence and only includes the information necessary for the analysis and thesis that: **True bitcoin ETF’s or BTC proper is by far a better investment than MSTR, and that MSTR is a self contained bubble.**

**\*\*$MSTR** \- MicroStrategy Incorporated provides artificial intelligence-powered enterprise analytics software and services in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and internationally. It offers MicroStrategy ONE, which provides non-technical users with the ability to directly access novel and actionable insights for decision-making….In addition, it engages in the development of bitcoin. I only put the two most important lines up in that description

**Market Capitalization** **-** $45.21B

**The numbers/financials:**

**1.**       **The (somewhat obsolete) core software business**  \- A disclaimer – these numbers currently aren’t factoring into the price of MSTR. If they were, this company would no longer exist. The price is explored more in point #2. Numbers are for Q3 2024

**a.       Total Revenue –** 116 mil, 10% decrease YOY

**b.      Gross profit –** 81.7 mil (70.4%) compared to 102.8 mil (79.4%) in Q3 2023

**c.       Operating expenses –** 514.3 mil, 301.6% YOY

**d.      EPS –** LOSS of $1.72 compared to analyst estimates of -0.12. A \~1500% miss

**e.       Cash & cash equivalents of 46.3 mil, decrease of 0.5 mil from end of fiscal 2023**

\*\***Note I am not insinuating that negative profits determine that a company is worthless. Many excellent companies experience negative profits for years. The problem here is contraction in profits and revenues consistently.\*\***

Saylor has recently described the software side of the business as a “cash cow” on an interview. I am unsure of what metric he is using to make that claim. Unless the cow is consuming cash rather than producing it. Regardless, I believe everyone is well aware now that the software side of the business gets almost zero attention from the company. While it is currently widely utilized among 5000+ companies, I believe there will come a time in the coming years that that part of the business just fades away into nothing, likely starting with dwindling product support.

**2.**       **Bitcoin holdings** – The business model of Microstrategy has basically changed to Bitcoin acquisition, and uses a metric MSTR has created called BTC yield, which it touts as the key performance indicator. More about BTC yield is explained in their financials, but essentially it is a measure of the efficiency/cost effectiveness of the way in which they acquire BTC. IT has nothing to do with the returns that BTC can generate the company or a shareholder, as one would think given the term “yield”

**a.**       **Total BTC holdings** – 252, 200, representing approximately 1% of the bitcoin that will ever be in circulation.

**i.**      **Cost** \- \~40, 000 USD per BTC on average, or a total of approximately 10.09B

**ii.**      **Current value -** \~70, 000 per BTC or 17.65B, a total of a 75% value add to the total BTC holdings since acquisition started in 2020

**3.**       **Shares and valuations –** 182.99M shares outstanding (Free float shares 162.91M)

**a.**       **Book value per share –** $18.62, representing a price to book value of \~13.5

**i.**      These numbers do not include any of the BTC on the books, per their financial statements.

**b.**      **BTC value per share -** $96.45 BTC exposure per share.

**c.**       **Current share price –** %250 +/- 20

**d.**      **Book value + BTC value per share –** 115.07 – representing an \*\*\***OVERVALUATION\*\*\*** of the company by $135 per share.

\*\*\***The BTC value per share represents a premium of $153.55 paid per share for the BTC exposure as compared to buying BTC directly\*\* The tradeoff/advantage advertised by Mr. Saylor is that MSTR has the ability to use leverage to acquire more BTC, thus amplifying stock price. The company is, in essence, becoming somewhat of a leveraged ETF for BTC with an extremely high entrance premium. So let’s talk about the effect of that and the stock price vs other strategies an investor could employ.**

 

**A.**      Volatility drag – Any leveraged product experiences volatility drag (also called volatility decay or beta slippage). Essentially, a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease in the product price (and the underlying price) will result in a lower net price than one started at. Therefore, the losses are amplified by the volatility drag.

**a.**       For example – one dollar increases in value by 10% to 1.10. Then due to the volatility of the dollar, it goes back down 10%. What you are left with is $0.99 rather than $1. This works in reverse as well (1 down to 0.9 then up to 0.99)

**b.**      What this means is that, the higher the volatility, the greater that volatility will decay your initial capital over time

**c.**       In the case of BTC, one of the most volatile holdings someone can include in their portfolio, a 2.5-3x leveraged product will experience 2.5-3x the losses from the swings that BTC will experience.

**i.      THIS IS WHY MSTR price is down 6.5% today while BTC is only down 1.7%**

**ii.**      All leveraged products experience this, which is why leveraged ETF’s are generally not meant to be held long term. The daily rebalancing of the ETF amplifies this decay.

**iii.**      MSTR is obviously not rebalanced daily, but the swings will drive up that decay in a big way

**B.**      The usual price pressures vs those on MSTR

**a.**       MSTR is being labeled as a leveraged ETF. However, leveraged ETF’s and ETF’s in general are subject to the price being heavily influenced by the iNAV rather than buying and selling pressures per se. (intraday net asset value)

**i.**      MSTR, however, is fully subject to the buying and selling pressures as it is a company, not an ETF.

**ii.**      This means that news that triggers a huge selloff can crush the stock price while the BTC it is supposedly tracking (and owning) remains high.

**iii.**      OF course those selling and buying pressures are also heavily influenced by the price of BTC.

So why is everyone enamoured with MSTR, driving the price up? My opinion is that Michael J. Saylor is an incredibly good salesman. He has been selling this so hard since starting bitcoin acquisition and has convinced you to give him money to buy BTC for the company instead of owning any yourself. He has also convinced you his company is better to hold than real BTC ETF’s such as **IBIT or the 2x leveraged BITX.** This simply doesn’t make sense given the numbers above. Bitcoin is the future, no doubt, but you own zero bitcoin by buying into MSTR, but are rather paying for a small amount of exposure. If the company went under tomorrow, despite the shares you own, you would see none of that BTC.

**Beyond that, Michael J. Saylor is an actual crook. He was found to have been filing fraudulent financial statements for MSTR in 2000, pumping the MSTR price. He was fined and disgorged. In June of this year, he reached a settlement with the AG for back-taxes. He had not paid taxes from 2005-2020. This alone is a reason I will never go long in this stock. He is selling you half empty glasses of future promises.**

1ghd1p4,The next recession might cause chaos due to high interest rates,0,"I'm not here to predict when the next recession will happen. However, we are in a weird spot with interest rates. A recession will increase government deficit spending (more money will be printed) while at the same time the fed will be dropping rates hard. The problem arises with long-term rates (10 and 30 year bonds). Right now, even though the fed is dropping rates, long term interest rates are slowly going up. The reason for that is quite simple. 

People don't really want to lend the US government money for long periods of time because it is almost certain that the money printer will obliterate the value of money in the long run. Do you really want to hold 30 year bonds that pay 4.5% per year when both presidential candidates will print money like there's no tomorrow? Any geopolitical conflict (war) will result in more money printing. Any economic weakness will result in more money printing. And if literally nothing happens, more money will be printed. Your upside is very clear, 4.5% per year, while the downside can be very high (inflation). 

So if we go into a recession, the fed will drop rates. But who in their right mind will buy long-term bonds (the same bonds which effect mortgage rates, credit card rates, and pretty much all other lending rates) knowing that the economy is about to go to shit and the government is about to start printing money in order to try to ""fix"" the economy? If there are not enough buyers, then the fed will have to start buying long-term bonds. But what if inflation returns as a result?

Starbucks has been shitting the bed lately, dropping in sales in the US and China. The stock gained back all of their losses when they hired the Chipotle CEO. Now SBUX is priced at 27 P/E which means the market is literally pricing in him not only stopping the bleeding but turning it back to growth. For the stock to go up, the turnaround would have to be fast and dramatic.

Brian Niccol, the new CEO does have an amazing track record, but here's why he has no chance. The guy only has US experience, and even if he helped Starbucks do a 180 in the US, it won't be enough. Starbucks no longer has an ""aspirational"" factor in China, Chinese people in general are turning against US brands except where the product is clearly exceptional (Apple). Starbucks is basically selling worse tasting drinks for 3x the price of competitors in China and nothing any CEO can do will stop the brand from collapsing there.

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG).. 

Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.

Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.

Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money? 

First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession. 

We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

1gh95em,Barrick and Newmont signaling local top in gold,0,"Because of Fed reserve balance sheet, gold/oz reaching $4,000 is highly likely.

I think gold will become another buying opportunity within the next 6 months for another \~80% monster run.

Gold is in that periodization in its near 15year cycle where it usually ends with a blow-off top.

Barrick is my preferred gold miner; better assets and more copper and it tends to trade with copper at times more than gold. Copper is looking bullish here which offset miner's costs so I lean toward gold per ounce coming down going into next year, possibly until Feb-March which is gold price season due to seasonal mines being offline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gh95em/barrick_and_newmont_signaling_local_top_in_gold/,investing,I

1gh73tb,ASML: An unbeatable monopoly?,42,"After ASML’s Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we’ll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it’s so difficult to replicate ASML.

[ASML engineers working on one part of a machine](https://preview.redd.it/zbnjr6u2yayd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7585c012e7baf4111a23a9d0345fb34574023d8b)

Let’s explain ASML first, in case you don’t know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML’s customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix.

You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world’s most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter).

**1. ASML’s long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched**. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: *“Well, aren’t competitors working on the same thing?”* They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML’s lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn’t make it work again.  We hope we made ASML’s lead clear with these statements. What’s even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML’s long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA).

[ASML roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/ti1s6bx4yayd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c4524acc1cfe72edb9f71708d6ea98cc73b007)

**2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers.** These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides.

[ASML patents](https://preview.redd.it/6z6x69dbyayd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f993999fe98bf9ab85db0c16446dd899388df47)

**3. ASML’s supplier network is inimitable.** The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn’t be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML. Many other suppliers solely produce for ASML, which means competitors have no access to the same technology. And to illustrate how complex this machine actually is: only ASML’s CO2 laser, made by Trumpf, consists of over 450.000 parts.

[Some ASML suppliers, like VDL and Carl Zeiss SMT](https://preview.redd.it/va79p99pyayd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1df1f362d9c31a331461e6c2f999d4ae7e4e28)

  
Now you can see why competing with one of the world’s most technologically advanced companies is nearly impossible. ASML is a true masterpiece, built on relentless hard work and collaboration.

EA Games beat estimates just last week and are almost at all time high. Their top new game for which many people including me were waiting for: Dragon Age Veilguard just came out yesterady, and despite the positive reviews is a woke flop.

> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gh4zwd/blackrock_launches_etf_that_expands_beyond_the/,stocks,"P, TOPT, CNBC, S, ETF, U"

Not sure if they are really concerned about their customers, or they've been lobbied by hedge funds to prevent ordinary people from destroying them.

lymdsh,Looking at my accounts in the morning,86523,,https://i.redd.it/ac69b8ql1al61.gif,wallstreetbets,
lalucf,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,86487,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/,wallstreetbets,"IRS, NONE, U, S, H, R, L, A, J, NEVER, TV"

That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Just look at the volume. People are not selling:

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn’t matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down. 

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday.

l82y7u,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,75153,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/,wallstreetbets,"P, S, NOT, ONLY, GME, A, I, EDIT"

l7sx9e,"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.",74739,"The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7sx9e/its_time_for_a_government_bailout_of_gme/,wallstreetbets,GME

l9runf,The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight,73300,"If you haven’t been browsing WSB or doing your own research, you’d probably think that the people on Twitter are correct in saying there is a silver squeeze happening and we should all get in on it. There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. 

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. 

If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. 

For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. 

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG

Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla.

Getting loans for buying stocks or putting your life's savings into this is not a great choice.,69249,"New members of this sub need to understand to only put in money that they can afford to lose. I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon 🚀""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

l7bpf5,30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,68598,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/,wallstreetbets,"DO, THE, HE, GRASP, TO, HOW, I, DR, YOU, TIME, THAT, IT, A, IS, NEED, SHUT, SAID, HOLD, DOWN, GME, DD, BUY, THEY"

tl;dr on tl;dr: Founder bad, greedy, got banned for being greedy. Being greedy again with new spotlight on the sub. 

tl;dr, in 2020 the original founder (after being gone for years and did nothing to contribute to the sub), along with a couple of mods, attempted to monetize the sub for personal gains. Users and other mods fought back. Hundreds of users got mass banned for speaking out, mods who spoke out got removed as mods. With some help from users, mods found precedent of another sub creator getting banned for trying to monetize a sub and sent plea to Reddit admins. Reddit admins banned offenders and gave sub back to the good mods. 

u/SpeaksInBooleans (RIP) investigated the circumstance of the events and made video exposing the offenders:

[Mega thread after the victory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx5zwf/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_him/) for reference. 

It's important to know/remember this now, because the same person that got exiled for being a tyrant is doing a media circus, trying to ride the current spotlight for personal gain, again. Hey CNN and WSJ, stop interviewing that dipshit. The sub has always been about its people, and what you guys wanted to do (as retarded as you are). No single person speaks for the sub and controls its destiny. It is in good hands with u/zjz aka u/SwineFluPandemic

Edit: He is spreading complete lies about the sub and the mods that got him removed:

>	Despite being its founder, Rogozinski was kicked out of the forum in April for trying to eliminate the hate speech plaguing the community.

>“There were a handful of mods who were straight up white supremacists,” he said.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best. 
Yours, Jordan.

Let's send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbm1ks/i_emailed_a_journalist_to_let_him_know_that_wsb/,wallstreetbets,"DOES, P, LOVES, CNBC, SLV, NOT, S, MSM, GME, A, I, WSB"

l97ykd,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,58213,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

&#x200B;

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that.

[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

laferl,15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),56968,"Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

 https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/ 

https://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png

(Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)

https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

Conversely, when the Oreo team reduces the amount of icing in their treats, markets tend to have great bull runs until once again society demands to push the boundaries of how much stuffing is possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oreo_varieties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets

1974: Double Stuf Oreo released. Dow Jones crashes 45%. FTSE drops 73%.

1987: Big Stuf Oreo released. Black Monday, a 20% single-day crash and a following bear market.

1991: Mini Oreo introduced. Smaller icing ratios coincide with the 1991 Japanese asset price bubble, confirming the correlation works both ways and a reduction of Oreo icing may be a potential solution to preventing a future crash.

2011: Triple Double Oreo introduced. S&P drops 21% in a 5-month bear market

2015: Oreo Thins introduced. A complete lack of icing causes an unprecedented bull run in the S&P for years

l8lxuy,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:",53075,"There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lxuy/if_your_friends_and_family_are_wondering_why/,wallstreetbets,"GME, A, I, DM, IOU"

Over the past few days, this subreddit has seen an absolutely insane amount of growth. In the past week, subscribers have quadrupled, pageviews have surpassed 1 BILLION, and the potential financial gains are unlimited!

We wanted to take a moment and teach all the newcomers what wallstreetbets is all about.

Wallstreetbets is a place of high risk, high reward, trades. Some are well thought out... but not usually.

#**We've got [losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

There was the guy who [bought gourd futures and lost everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/), the guy who [turned a $5,000 investment into a $58,000 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/), the guy who [put everything on the Argentinian peso, hours before it collapsed](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpcao5/the_guy_that_called_argentina_to_tank_was_right/eworkdq/), the guy who [had to take physical delivery of oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamjdk) and [""GUH"" which is a video you just need to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/). You can check out some more of [those losses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got [gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

Like resident GameStop multimillionaires u/deepfuckingvalue, we had the guy [who accidentally made $110K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamo3x), there's the guy who [shorted the powerball lottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3zvxp5/shorting_powerball_update/) You can check out some more of [those gains here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got general craziness!**

Like when [we found the ""infinite money cheat code"" on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drt5tr/guh_of_fame_2019/), forcing [Robinhood to post to WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4r0sy/robinhood_statement_on_options_collateral_and/) and push an update disabling options, we had [the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/), regularly posting, livestreaming, and even becoming a moderator. We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March. We have people who lost bets and had to [drink their pee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak2gf/i_said_if_spy_closed_green_today_i_would_drink_my/) and [tattoo our logo on their butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/) (NSFW).

So if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. 

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3uz/why_should_any_american_company_ever_act/,wallstreetbets,"PE, I, QE, CEO, WSB"

ll68pc,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day.",49444,"Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

EDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.  Which contains a lot of GME. Here is XRT.  Hmmm.  Notice anything interesting about Jan29th between these two??

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Edit:  Adding some historical counts for GME below.  I'm too lazy to combine the data right now, pulling from an older post of mine.

Edit:  I have a super super small position in GME, like 3 shares.  I have been on WSB since like 2014.  Trust me.  I am NOT a bag-holding whiner.  I take my losses like a fucking champ.
