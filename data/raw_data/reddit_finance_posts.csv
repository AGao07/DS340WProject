1glx7j4,"$TOST is probably something that will have boring earnings, but I'm going to play it anyway.",1,"I'm not one for long, drawn-out DD's with oodles of scribbles on graphs, so here's the quick and dirty:

* $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet.
* $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open.
* $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.

I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow. If it's an earning miss, then we're likely looking at a similar fall of 5%, but I feel it will still add some recovery on Friday/Monday. Price target of $34-$35 after earnings, and if earnings are good, $42-$44 by EOY.

The company I work for got bought out by PFGC. I now have the choice to by stock options at a 15% discount at 1%-15% of my POST TAX income. I believe this is replacing my current 401k program which I currently have maxed out. All my extra income goes into a brokerage account for SPY (I know I should get a ROTH IRA, I’ll do it one day…maybe?). I’m just a normal wagie, I made some stock picks in the past before, some winners, mostly losers. I’m smart enough to know I’m not smart in stock picks.

My question is:
Do I take advantage of the stock options program? Do I max out the contribution rate?

If you were to buy and hold the 10k you're portfolio would basically follow the stock price. Pretty straightforward.

But what if you sell when it drops a certain level and buy when it increases a certain level. Say -5% & +10% rule. Here's the catch, you don't sell and buy the whole portfolio you sell just the part that you gained and ""reinvest"".

1glrz84,🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀,362,"**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.

**Why the New Japan Deal Matters**

Archer's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.

**Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**

ACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.

**Key Graphs to Watch**

* **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure.
* **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same.
* **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector.
* **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.

**Final Thoughts**

Archer is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.

1glmw02,Core-satellite split between regular and retirement brokerages?,2,"I've been investing in global ETFs like S&P500 and MSCI ACWI so far.

1glletv,ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term),6,"ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+€ to 610€ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 € yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 € PUTs with December 20th expiry.

1glgzkk,Recommendations for Lower Risk Investment Strategies - Buffer Savings for Payroll for my Business,7,"So I've been a one-man show for a couple years. I bought the book of business for an IT consulting firm from a guy who was looking to retire. I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling. 

Based on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)

I've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done. 

Now, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech. 

I've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years.

Reddit is Yelp, it’s Craigslist/Facebook marketplace, it’s $PINS and more. It’s generally promoted as every search result on Google and it’s a place where nearly all of my circle uses it for conversation when attempting to find answers. You regards use it to light literally all your money on fire and advertisers are starting to do the same thing. 

Most users are in USA, so explosive growth is there for the taking outside of the USA. They haven’t totally monetized their ads model yet, and their paid search is on the way. They’re also driving more ads into threads. 

Because Reddit users follow their most important interests, and interact with them directly, it’s also one of the most targeted ways to serve ads. 

So why isn’t this company worth $51b or nearly $340/share in two years at a 15x?

Is the bear case really “it’s a bot driven site” and share based compensation?

They also have untapped potential in training LLM models, 1 billion in organic search, etc.

1glf4c3,$QXO: The Brad Jacobs Freight Train You’re All Sleeping On,7,"Regards,

Listen up - here’s the deal on QXO. I’m not here to give you some penny stock pitch that’s gonna end with you crying to your bank. I’m talking Brad Jacobs—a name that actually commands respect in business. He took XPO from being small fry to a $15 billion freight monster, and now he’s back for another round. But let’s be real, if you’re looking for some pump-and-dump garbage, this ain’t for you.

The Big Picture: Owning a $1 Trillion Industry
Jacobs doesn’t mess around. He’s here to take over the building products distribution market, which is a trillion-dollar industry begging for a savior to come in and shake it up. When he took on XPO, the logistics industry was a hot mess of inefficiency and disarray. Fast-forward a decade, and XPO is a name every freight guy knows. Now he’s got his sights set on QXO, and this isn’t for some pocket change. This is a takeover.

$5 Billion Cash Stash and No Debt—No Chains Holding QXO Back
Unlike all those broke startups praying for investor mercy, QXO has $5 billion in cold, hard cash with zero debt. That’s right—no loans, no strings, no BS holding them back. They’re not out here begging for quarters; they’re ready to buy, expand, and roll out a carpet of domination.

Why does that matter? Because QXO doesn’t need to play games. They’re stacked with cash, ready to make moves that’ll put smaller players in the rearview. Jacobs isn’t here to gamble; he’s here to grab the industry by the throat, and he’s got the war chest to do it.

The Kushner Factor – Like It or Not
Here’s something juicy for the conspiracy theorists: Jared Kushner is on the board. Yeah, some of you might hate him, but this guy’s got connections up to his eyeballs. And those connections come with cash. His firm, Affinity Partners, dropped a fat $150 million into QXO. Don’t like it? Too bad. Kushner’s network isn’t here to make friends; it’s here to get things done, open doors, and give QXO a reach into corners you don’t even know exist.

When you’re trying to flip a trillion-dollar market on its head, having someone with global influence doesn’t hurt. Kushner might not be your buddy, but trust me, he’s good for business.

Jacobs’ Legacy: The Guy Knows How to Print Money
Listen up, because this isn’t some snake oil show. Jacobs’ track record is rock solid. This guy has pulled off business miracles before, and he doesn’t deal in hype—he deals in results. When he took on XPO, he didn’t just win; he redefined the game. XPO is now a giant, and Jacobs is ready to do the same with QXO.

So, if you’re waiting for him to stumble, keep waiting. Jacobs’ whole career has been about taking scrappy underdogs and turning them into business beasts. Now he’s taking everything he knows and throwing it into QXO. If you can’t see the potential, maybe stick to meme stocks.

The Stock Split Debacle – Here’s What Actually Happened
Ah, the infamous 1-for-8 reverse split. Yeah, that was a bit of a ride, but let me break it down for you: this wasn’t some sneaky “oh no, we’re failing” move. This was QXO setting itself up to be taken seriously by institutional investors. The split pushed the price up, making QXO look less like a penny stock and more like a heavyweight. But some of you lost your minds when it hit $235 on June 10th and the market cap skyrocketed to $90 billion. Did QXO magically become worth as much as Amazon overnight? No, don’t be dumb.

Here’s what went down: because of the share structure change, there were way fewer shares out there for the taking. The supply got tighter than a drum, so naturally, the price shot up, and platforms didn’t adjust fast enough. It was a hiccup. The market cap was basically a mirage, not a problem with the company. If you panicked, that’s on you, not QXO.

Since then, it’s settled down to a more reasonable $15.25 as of today. This isn’t volatility due to bad business. It’s due to mechanics. QXO still has the same cash pile, no debt, and Jacobs at the helm. If you got weak knees over a glitch in the system, you’re not cut out for this play.

QXO’s Under the Radar – and Underpriced
Here’s the deal: the market’s napping on QXO. Despite the players on board, this stock is still low-key. People are too busy betting on whatever’s hyped that day. But if you can look past the nonsense, this is one of the most undervalued plays you’ll find. Don’t believe me? Look at Trump’s election. QXO didn’t budge. No hype, no pump—it’s steady because it’s built for the long haul.

This isn’t a meme stock. It’s not chasing clout. It’s positioning for a colossal win that takes years, not days. If you don’t have the patience, keep walking.

For the Diamond Hands Only
If you’re here for a 3-day flip, leave now. QXO isn’t for the paper-handed. This is a stock for people who see the big picture, who understand that building value takes time. Brad Jacobs has done it before, and he’s doing it again. You want in? Then you’re here for the ride, no whining allowed. In a few years, QXO will be leading in building products, and the weak hands will be nowhere to be found.

So keep chasing those meme plays if that’s your thing, but for the real players—the ones who see Jacobs’ vision—QXO is one of the few long-term buys that could actually make you rich.

1gldduj,I was early and wrong so you don't have to be $COIN,24,"I went all in on Coinbase shortly after IPO in 2021 around $300/share, with a very loose thesis, ""I don't get it but probably it will keep going up""

Total investment around that time was $100k shares.

The stock fell, chopped, rebounded and then fell some more all the way to $35. During the long painful bear market my conviction in the company grew due to actually understanding the technology, it's potential, and Coinbase's strategy. I sold my shares and bought leap calls, (quite some time before the actual $35 bottom), I ended up closing a loss of $80k. I rolled into new leaps, bought the dip, and was locked in to the industry news. Every time I thought about walking away I just couldn't because ""the industry has never looked more promising than it does today"".

It would be easy not to notice if you weren't paying attention, but the rate at which products are shipping, and builder culture is growing is just incredible, and in large part thanks to the Coinbase team, especially Jessie, the founder of their etherium layer 2 Base. 

Anyway, come oct 2023, things are looking pretty bullish and it's smooth sailing for my portfolio from ~$20k low to $450k at the March top of this year. Incredible, but the blow off top wasn't ready. So I rode that all the way back down to $90k, rolling as necessary, and buying the dip. 

Well, now here we are following the Trump election, the most pro crypto Congress ever (250+ pro crypto candidates elected to the house and 16 to the Senate), Trump is going to remove Gensler, which you don't need the whole story but Gensler has been a major thorn in the side of the crypto industry. 

It's also been ~6 months since the Bitcoin halfing, which, if you believe the technical folks, they say is about the correct amount of time to start seeing a supply squeeze affect Bitcoin prices. We also just broke all time high on BTC, entering price discovery. 

Here is the most stupid simple trade of your life, and congratulations, you didn't have to trudge through the mud for 4 years like I did (I'm a moron). 

Coinbase historically tracks BTC  with 2-3x more reactivity (as a percentage), but in the past 6 months it has deviated, see attached image.
My hypothesis, is that Coinbase is going to play catch-up with BTC, with a short term exponential move (we saw the start of this today Coin up 30% vs BTC up 2%). Once Coinbase is back on parity, it should resume it's 2-3x outperformance on the rally.

BTC is going up, I have three rough targets for Feb 25:
Bear: $100k-120k, $400-600 COIN
Base: $120-150k, $600-800 COIN
Bull: $150-250k, $800-$1500 COIN

1glceac,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,78,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

**2. Tarriffs and EV Tax credits**

EV Tax credits are definitely going bye bye which is bullish for Tesla since now more companies are going to bleed money like crazy until you realize the only selling point of a Tesla is you get a 7500 dollar tax credit, now it will just be a 45k+ luxury vehicle for most people.

Who pays for the 40 billion dollars? Not china, shareholders do meaning the entire company is devalued by 40 billion dollars.

1gl9i2e,E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,97,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Anyway, my credit cards will be paid off very quickly when I start the new job becuase of the salary increase but I will not be able to participate in the firm’s 401k for a year.

1gl69j8,Trump win Bullish or Bearish for GOLD?,0,"Gold has had a pretty good rally up until recently. You think it'll keep going up and break ATH now that Trump won or will the pattern reverse?

Trump’s previous term did see significant fluctuations in gold prices, influenced by both his policies and larger market trends. Some analysts argue that Trump’s stance on fiscal policy, especially around trade and spending, could create an environment where gold thrives. If somehow there’s renewed uncertainty or if inflation concerns rise, gold could benefit from that risk-averse sentiment.

On the other hand, if he sticks to his word and stops the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, then the new ""peaceful climate"" could cause gold prices to drop, as gold is seen as a safe haven asset that people flock to during economic and geopolitical turmoil.

The recent rally has been strong, and some traders are starting to worry about whether the price is sustainable. A correction wouldn’t be unusual, especially if markets start factoring in potential stability or if there’s a push toward riskier assets. Additionally, interest rates can play a huge role in gold prices. If there’s a shift toward higher rates, we might see downward pressure on gold as investors turn to interest-bearing assets.

At this point, it feels like a coin toss. The key factors to watch will be any policy announcements from Trump, how markets react in the coming months, and of course, global economic conditions.

1. Fundamentals Are Turning Around 📈: Corsair’s core business has seen a lot of improvements, with demand stabilizing after the pandemic highs and lows. The company’s gaming peripherals and PC components are still flying off the shelves, and they’re expanding into new product categories. They’ve streamlined operations, reduced overhead, and positioned themselves to be cash flow positive in the coming quarters.

2. Partnership with Call of Duty 🎮: Corsair just locked in a partnership with Call of Duty, which brings them closer to the gaming community than ever. This move isn’t just a branding gimmick – it’s a strategic alignment with one of the most iconic franchises in gaming, which could give Corsair a strong edge in the competitive esports and streaming markets. COD players and streamers are hardcore about their setups, and Corsair’s gear has a loyal following among them.

3. Strong Product Portfolio 💻: From high-performance gaming keyboards to streaming gear, Corsair has all the toys gamers want, and they keep innovating. Gaming and streaming aren’t just trends – they’re part of the new way we live and entertain. Corsair is doubling down, which is exactly what we want to see in the long term.

I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I’m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?

I’ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I’ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they’ll probably go up again in the future. However, I’m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs

1gl4aww,Gold/oz down as predicted.,0,"I have been timing the market for over 10 years. Elsewhere and earlier I predicted gold per ounce would go down, my thesis was that miners (GOLD:Barrick and NEM:Newmont) usually front run gold price. There can be multiple factors in figuring the price of a miner, oil and copper are usually the big externalities.

Copper price will make a mine more profitable, usually.  
Oil will add to cost.

I assessed a couple weeks ago that it was unlikely that oil cost would become excessive, having been much higher in the last year when gold was a lower price, and that copper is in a lull. I'm bullish both copper and oil.

Thus I concluded that gold miners were front running the gold price.

My target was the 20 weekly; we are only at the 50daily. But I think we will hit the 20 weekly in which case I'll start to buy gold miners or I'll buy gold outright.

  
Gold makes up about 68% of my portfolio; so I've been selling covered calls on GLD to finance holding the asset which is considered to have a ""negative yield"". I generate about 3% dividend yearly from this strategy buy-hold.

So Gold has historically been my ""buy forever"" from selling profits elsewhere. I think after this run though we will see a 10+ year gold bear market. This is due to the ""behavior of money"". Money behaves a certain way in money markets. Gold will top out somewhere near $4,000 est. and then it'll enter a long bear market. Gold has done this 3 times before since the early 1970s. So there's no reason to think it's not a mechanical reality in a delicate balance of interest rate parities, currency availability and liquidity globally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gl4aww/goldoz_down_as_predicted/,investing,"I, NEM, GOLD, GLD"
